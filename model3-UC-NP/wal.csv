b.HEB.3.18 And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest but to them that believed not,b.HEB.3.18 (b.HEB.3.18) And (Qassi) to (NULL) whom (Xoossai) sware (NULL) he (i) that (NULL) they (caaqqidee) should (mala) not (NULL) enter (gelenna) into (NULL) his (NULL) rest (shemppiyoosaa) but (attin) to (NULL) them (etayyo) that (NULL) believed (caaqqidoogaappe) not (NULL) 
b.HEB.3.19 So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief,b.HEB.3.19 (b.HEB.3.19) So (NULL) we (nuuni) see (be7oos) that (NULL) they (Eti) could (danddayibeennaagaa) not (NULL) enter (gelanau) in (NULL) because (gishshau) of (NULL) unbelief (ammanibeenna) 
b.HEB.4.1 Let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it,b.HEB.4.1 (b.HEB.4.1) Let (NULL) us (NULL) therefore (Simmi) fear (NULL) lest (gelennan) a (NULL) promise (NULL) being (NULL) left (NULL) us (NULL) of (NULL) entering (Gelissana) into (he) his (ba) rest (shemppiyoosaa) any (ooninne) of (NULL) you (intteppe) should (mala) seem (NULL) to (NULL) come (NULL) short (yayyoos) of (NULL) it (NULL) 
b.HEB.4.2 For unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it,b.HEB.4.2 (b.HEB.4.2) For (Aissi) unto (NULL) us (NULL) was (NULL) the (NULL) gospel (wonggeliyaa) preached (NULL) as (NULL) well (NULL) as (NULL) unto (NULL) them (NULL) but (shin) the (NULL) word (siyidoogaadan) preached (NULL) did (NULL) not (NULL) profit (ainne) them (NULL) not (NULL) being (gishshau) mixed (ekkibeenna) with (NULL) faith (ammanidi) in (NULL) them (NULL) that (NULL) heard (siyidosona) it (go77ibeenna) 
b.HEB.4.3 For we which have believed do enter into rest as he said As I have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world,b.HEB.4.3 (b.HEB.4.3) For (NULL) we (nuuni) which (NULL) have (NULL) believed (ammanidaageeti) do (NULL) enter (gelana) into (NULL) rest (shemppiyoosaa) as (giidoogaadan) he (i) said (NULL) As (polettidaagaa) I (Taani) have (NULL) sworn (caaqqada) in (NULL) my (NULL) wrath (hanqqetta) if (NULL) they (Eti) shall (mulekka) enter (gelana) into (NULL) my (NULL) rest (shemppiyoosaa) although (yaagaas) the (NULL) works (oosoi) were (NULL) finished (NULL) from (doommin) the (NULL) foundation (merettoosappe) of (NULL) the (NULL) world (sa7ai) 
b.HEB.4.4 For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise And God did rest the seventh day from all his works,b.HEB.4.4 (b.HEB.4.4) For (Aissi) he (NULL) spake (gallassaabaa) in (NULL) a (NULL) certain (NULL) place (issisan) of (NULL) the (NULL) seventh (NULL) day (NULL) on (NULL) this (NULL) wise (NULL) And (NULL) God (Xoossaa) did (NULL) rest (NULL) the (NULL) seventh (NULL) day (NULL) from (NULL) all (ubbaappe) his (ba) works (ooso)

b.HEB.4.10 For he that is entered into his rest he also hath ceased from his own works as God did from his,b.HEB.4.10 (b.HEB.4.10) For (Aissi) he (NULL) that (NULL) is (NULL) entered (NULL) into (NULL) his (NULL) rest (shemppiyoosaa) he (NULL) also (NULL) hath (Xoossai) ceased (NULL) from (NULL) his (NULL) own (ba) works (NULL) as (NULL) God (Xoossai) did (shemppidoogaadan) from (NULL) his (NULL)
