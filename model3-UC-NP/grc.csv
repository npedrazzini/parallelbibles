b.JOH.15.24 If I had not done among them the works which none other man did they had not had sin but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father,b.JOH.15.24 (b.JOH.15.24) If (εἰ) I (NULL) had (NULL) not (μὴ) done (ἐποίησα) among (ἐν) them (αὐτοῖς) the (NULL) works (ἔργα) which (ἃ) none (οὐδεὶς) other (ἄλλος) man (NULL) did (ἐποίησεν) they (NULL) had (NULL) not (μὴ) had (NULL) sin (ἁμαρτίαν) but (δὲ) now (νῦν) have (NULL) they (NULL) both (καὶ) seen (ἑωράκασιν) and (καὶ) hated (μεμισήκασιν) both (καὶ) me (ἐμὲ) and (καὶ) my (μου) Father (πατέρα) 
b.JOH.15.25 But this cometh to pass that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law They hated me without a cause,b.JOH.15.25 (b.JOH.15.25) But (ἀλλ) this (NULL) cometh (NULL) to (NULL) pass (NULL) that (NULL) the (NULL) word (λόγος) might (ἵνα) be (NULL) fulfilled (πληρωθῇ) that (NULL) is (NULL) written (γεγραμμένος) in (ἐν) their (αὐτῶν) law (νόμῳ) They (NULL) hated (ἐμίσησάν) me (με) without (NULL) a (NULL) cause (δωρεάν) 
b.JOH.15.26 But when the Comforter is come whom I will send unto you from the Father even the Spirit of truth which proceedeth from the Father he shall testify of me,b.JOH.15.26 (b.JOH.15.26) But (NULL) when (ὅταν) the (NULL) Comforter (παράκλητος) is (NULL) come (ἔλθῃ) whom (ὃν) I (ἐγὼ) will (NULL) send (πέμψω) unto (NULL) you (ὑμῖν) from (παρὰ) the (NULL) Father (πατρός) even (NULL) the (NULL) Spirit (πνεῦμα) of (τῆς) truth (ἀληθείας) which (ὃ) proceedeth (ἐκπορεύεται) from (παρὰ) the (NULL) Father (πατρός) he (ἐκεῖνος) shall (NULL) testify (μαρτυρήσει) of (τῆς) me (ἐμοῦ)

b.JOH.16.3 And these things will they do unto you because they have not known the Father nor me,b.JOH.16.3 (b.JOH.16.3) And (καὶ) these (ταῦτα) things (NULL) will (NULL) they (NULL) do (ποιήσουσιν) unto (NULL) you (NULL) because (ὅτι) they (NULL) have (NULL) not (οὐκ) known (ἔγνωσαν) the (τὸν) Father (πατέρα) nor (οὐδὲ) me (ἐμέ) 
b.JOH.16.4 But these things have I told you that when the time shall come ye may remember that I told you of them And these things I said not unto you at the beginning because I was with you,b.JOH.16.4 (b.JOH.16.4) But (ἀλλὰ) these (ταῦτα) things (NULL) have (NULL) I (NULL) told (λελάληκα) you (ὑμῖν) that (ἵνα) when (ὅταν) the (NULL) time (ὥρα) shall (NULL) come (ἔλθῃ) ye (NULL) may (NULL) remember (μνημονεύητε) that (ἵνα) I (NULL) told (λελάληκα) you (ὑμῖν) of (ἐξ) them (αὐτῶν) And (δὲ) these (ταῦτα) things (NULL) I (NULL) said (εἶπον) not (οὐκ) unto (NULL) you (ὑμῖν) at (NULL) the (NULL) beginning (ἀρχῆς) because (ὅτι) I (NULL) was (ἤμην) with (μεθ) you (ὑμῖν) 
b.JOH.16.5 But now I go my way to him that sent me and none of you asketh me Whither goest thou,b.JOH.16.5 (b.JOH.16.5) But (δὲ) now (νῦν) I (NULL) go (ὑπάγω) my (NULL) way (NULL) to (πρὸς) him (NULL) that (NULL) sent (πέμψαντά) me (με) and (καὶ) none (οὐδεὶς) of (ἐξ) you (ὑμῶν) asketh (ἐρωτᾷ) me (με) Whither (ποῦ) goest (ὑπάγεις) thou (NULL)

b.GAL.2.16 Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by the faith of Jesus Christ even we have believed in Jesus Christ that we might be justified by the faith of Christ and not by the works of the law for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified,b.GAL.2.16 (b.GAL.2.16) Knowing (εἰδότες) that (ὅτι) a (NULL) man (ἄνθρωπος) is (NULL) not (οὐ) justified (δικαιοῦται) by (ἐξ) the (NULL) works (ἔργων) of (NULL) the (NULL) law (νόμου) but (μὴ) by (ἐξ) the (NULL) faith (πίστεως) of (NULL) Jesus (Ἰησοῦ) Christ (Χριστοῦ) even (καὶ) we (ἡμεῖς) have (NULL) believed (ἐπιστεύσαμεν) in (εἰς) Jesus (Ἰησοῦ) Christ (Χριστοῦ) that (ὅτι) we (ἡμεῖς) might (ἵνα) be (NULL) justified (δικαιοῦται) by (ἐξ) the (NULL) faith (πίστεως) of (NULL) Christ (Χριστοῦ) and (καὶ) not (οὐ) by (ἐξ) the (NULL) works (ἔργων) of (NULL) the (NULL) law (νόμου) for (ὅτι) by (ἐξ) the (NULL) works (ἔργων) of (NULL) the (NULL) law (νόμου) shall (ἐὰν) no (NULL) flesh (σάρξ) be (NULL) justified (δικαιοῦται) 
b.GAL.2.17 But if while we seek to be justified by Christ we ourselves also are found sinners is therefore Christ the minister of sin God forbid,b.GAL.2.17 (b.GAL.2.17) But (δὲ) if (εἰ) while (ζητοῦντες) we (NULL) seek (NULL) to (NULL) be (NULL) justified (δικαιωθῆναι) by (ἐν) Christ (Χριστῷ) we (NULL) ourselves (εὑρέθημεν) also (καὶ) are (NULL) found (NULL) sinners (ἁμαρτωλοί) is (NULL) therefore (ἆρα) Christ (Χριστῷ) the (NULL) minister (διάκονος) of (NULL) sin (ἁμαρτίας) God (μὴ) forbid (γένοιτο)

b.HEB.2.17 Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people,b.HEB.2.17 (b.HEB.2.17) Wherefore (ὅθεν) in (κατὰ) all (πάντα) things (NULL) it (NULL) behoved (ὁμοιωθῆναι) him (NULL) to (NULL) be (NULL) made (NULL) like (ἐλεήμων) unto (τοῖς) his (NULL) brethren (ἀδελφοῖς) that (NULL) he (NULL) might (ἵνα) be (NULL) a (NULL) merciful (NULL) and (καὶ) faithful (πιστὸς) high (ἀρχιερεὺς) priest (NULL) in (κατὰ) things (NULL) pertaining (NULL) to (NULL) God (θεόν) to (NULL) make (NULL) reconciliation (ἱλάσκεσθαι) for (NULL) the (τὰς) sins (ἁμαρτίας) of (τοῦ) the (τὰς) people (λαοῦ) 
b.HEB.2.18 For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted he is able to succour them that are tempted,b.HEB.2.18 (b.HEB.2.18) For (γὰρ) in (ἐν) that (NULL) he (NULL) himself (αὐτὸς) hath (NULL) suffered (πέπονθεν) being (NULL) tempted (πειρασθείς) he (NULL) is (NULL) able (δύναται) to (τοῖς) succour (πειραζομένοις) them (NULL) that (NULL) are (NULL) tempted (πειρασθείς) 
b.HEB.3.1 Wherefore holy brethren partakers of the heavenly calling consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession Christ Jesus,b.HEB.3.1 (b.HEB.3.1) Wherefore (Ὅθεν) holy (ἅγιοι) brethren (ἀδελφοὶ) partakers (μέτοχοι) of (NULL) the (NULL) heavenly (ἐπουρανίου) calling (κλήσεως) consider (κατανοήσατε) the (NULL) Apostle (ἀπόστολον) and (καὶ) High (NULL) Priest (ἀρχιερέα) of (NULL) our (ἡμῶν) profession (ὁμολογίας) Christ (NULL) Jesus (Ἰησοῦν) 
b.HEB.3.2 Who was faithful to him that appointed him as also Moses was faithful in all his house,b.HEB.3.2 (b.HEB.3.2) Who (NULL) was (NULL) faithful (πιστὸν) to (τῷ) him (NULL) that (NULL) appointed (ποιήσαντι) him (NULL) as (ὡς) also (καὶ) Moses (Μωϋσῆς) was (NULL) faithful (πιστὸν) in (ἐν) all (ὅλῳ) his (αὐτοῦ) house (οἴκῳ) 
b.HEB.3.3 For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house,b.HEB.3.3 (b.HEB.3.3) For (γὰρ) this (οὗτος) man (NULL) was (NULL) counted (πλείονος) worthy (ἠξίωται) of (NULL) more (NULL) glory (δόξης) than (παρὰ) Moses (Μωϋσῆν) inasmuch (καθ) as (ὅσον) he (NULL) who (NULL) hath (ἔχει) builded (κατασκευάσας) the (NULL) house (οἴκου) hath (ἔχει) more (NULL) honour (τιμὴν) than (παρὰ) the (NULL) house (οἴκου) 
b.HEB.3.4 For every house is builded by some man but he that built all things is God,b.HEB.3.4 (b.HEB.3.4) For (γὰρ) every (πᾶς) house (οἶκος) is (NULL) builded (κατασκευάζεται) by (NULL) some (ὑπό) man (τινος) but (δὲ) he (NULL) that (NULL) built (κατασκευάσας) all (πάντα) things (NULL) is (NULL) God (θεός) 
b.HEB.3.5 And Moses verily was faithful in all his house as a servant for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after,b.HEB.3.5 (b.HEB.3.5) And (καὶ) Moses (Μωϋσῆς) verily (μὲν) was (NULL) faithful (πιστὸς) in (ἐν) all (ὅλῳ) his (αὐτοῦ) house (οἴκῳ) as (ὡς) a (NULL) servant (θεράπων) for (εἰς) a (NULL) testimony (μαρτύριον) of (τῶν) those (NULL) things (NULL) which (NULL) were (NULL) to (τῷ) be (NULL) spoken (NULL) after (λαληθησομένων) 
b.HEB.3.6 But Christ as a son over his own house whose house are we if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end,b.HEB.3.6 (b.HEB.3.6) But (δὲ) Christ (Χριστὸς) as (ὡς) a (NULL) son (υἱὸς) over (ἐπὶ) his (αὐτοῦ) own (NULL) house (οἶκον) whose (οὗ) house (οἶκον) are (ἐσμεν) we (NULL) if (ἐάν) we (NULL) hold (NULL) fast (NULL) the (NULL) confidence (παρρησίαν) and (καὶ) the (NULL) rejoicing (καύχημα) of (τῆς) the (NULL) hope (ἐλπίδος) firm (μέχρι) unto (NULL) the (NULL) end (κατάσχωμεν) 
b.HEB.3.7 Wherefore as the Holy Ghost saith To day if ye will hear his voice,b.HEB.3.7 (b.HEB.3.7) Wherefore (Διό) as (καθὼς) the (τὸ) Holy (πνεῦμα) Ghost (ἅγιον) saith (λέγει) To (NULL) day (σήμερον) if (ἐὰν) ye (NULL) will (NULL) hear (ἀκούσητε) his (αὐτοῦ) voice (φωνῆς) 
b.HEB.3.8 Harden not your hearts as in the provocation in the day of temptation in the wilderness,b.HEB.3.8 (b.HEB.3.8) Harden (σκληρύνητε) not (μὴ) your (ὑμῶν) hearts (καρδίας) as (ὡς) in (ἐν) the (τῷ) provocation (παραπικρασμῷ) in (ἐν) the (τῷ) day (ἡμέραν) of (τοῦ) temptation (πειρασμοῦ) in (ἐν) the (τῷ) wilderness (ἐρήμῳ) 
b.HEB.3.9 When your fathers tempted me proved me and saw my works forty years,b.HEB.3.9 (b.HEB.3.9) When (NULL) your (ὑμῶν) fathers (πατέρες) tempted (ἐπείρασαν) me (NULL) proved (δοκιμασίᾳ) me (NULL) and (καὶ) saw (εἶδον) my (μου) works (ἔργα) forty (τεσσεράκοντα) years (ἔτη) 
b.HEB.3.10 Wherefore I was grieved with that generation and said They do alway err in their heart and they have not known my ways,b.HEB.3.10 (b.HEB.3.10) Wherefore (διὸ) I (NULL) was (NULL) grieved (προσώχθισα) with (τῇ) that (NULL) generation (γενεᾷ) and (καὶ) said (εἶπον) They (NULL) do (NULL) alway (ἀεὶ) err (πλανῶνται) in (τῇ) their (NULL) heart (καρδίᾳ) and (καὶ) they (αὐτοὶ) have (NULL) not (οὐκ) known (ἔγνωσαν) my (μου) ways (ὁδούς) 
b.HEB.3.11 So I sware in my wrath They shall not enter into my rest,b.HEB.3.11 (b.HEB.3.11) So (NULL) I (NULL) sware (ὤμοσα) in (ἐν) my (μου) wrath (ὀργῇ) They (NULL) shall (NULL) not (NULL) enter (εἰσελεύσονται) into (εἰς) my (μου) rest (κατάπαυσίν) 
b.HEB.3.12 Take heed brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God,b.HEB.3.12 (b.HEB.3.12) Take (NULL) heed (βλέπετε) brethren (ἀδελφοί) lest (μήποτε) there (NULL) be (ἔσται) in (NULL) any (ἔν) of (NULL) you (ὑμῶν) an (τινι) evil (πονηρὰ) heart (καρδία) of (NULL) unbelief (ἀπιστίας) in (NULL) departing (ἀποστῆναι) from (ἀπὸ) the (NULL) living (ζῶντος) God (θεοῦ) 
b.HEB.3.13 But exhort one another daily while it is called To day lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin,b.HEB.3.13 (b.HEB.3.13) But (ἀλλὰ) exhort (παρακαλεῖτε) one (NULL) another (NULL) daily (ἡμέραν) while (ἑκάστην) it (NULL) is (NULL) called (καλεῖται) To (ἄχρις) day (σήμερον) lest (ἵνα) any (τις) of (ἐξ) you (ὑμῶν) be (NULL) hardened (σκληρυνθῇ) through (NULL) the (NULL) deceitfulness (ἀπάτῃ) of (ἐξ) sin (ἁμαρτίας) 
b.HEB.3.14 For we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end,b.HEB.3.14 (b.HEB.3.14) For (γὰρ) we (NULL) are (NULL) made (NULL) partakers (μέτοχοι) of (τοῦ) Christ (Χριστοῦ) if (γεγόναμεν) we (NULL) hold (ἐάνπερ) the (τὴν) beginning (ἀρχὴν) of (τοῦ) our (ὑποστάσεως) confidence (NULL) stedfast (μέχρι) unto (NULL) the (τὴν) end (κατάσχωμεν) 
b.HEB.3.15 While it is said To day if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts as in the provocation,b.HEB.3.15 (b.HEB.3.15) While (NULL) it (NULL) is (NULL) said (NULL) To (NULL) day (NULL) if (NULL) ye (NULL) will (NULL) hear (NULL) his (NULL) voice (NULL) harden (NULL) not (NULL) your (NULL) hearts (NULL) as (NULL) in (ἐν) the (τῷ) provocation (λέγεσθαι) 
b.HEB.3.15 While it is said To day if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts as in the provocation,b.HEB.3.15 (b.HEB.3.15) While (NULL) it (NULL) is (NULL) said (NULL) To (NULL) day (NULL) if (NULL) ye (NULL) will (NULL) hear (NULL) his (NULL) voice (NULL) harden (NULL) not (NULL) your (NULL) hearts (NULL) as (NULL) in (ἐν) the (τῷ) provocation (λέγεσθαι) 
b.HEB.3.16 For some when they had heard did provoke howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses,b.HEB.3.16 (b.HEB.3.16) For (γὰρ) some (τίνες) when (NULL) they (NULL) had (NULL) heard (ἀκούσαντες) did (NULL) provoke (παρεπίκραναν) howbeit (ἀλλ) not (οὐ) all (πάντες) that (οἱ) came (NULL) out (ἐξελθόντες) of (ἐξ) Egypt (Αἰγύπτου) by (διὰ) Moses (Μωϋσέως) 
b.HEB.3.17 But with whom was he grieved forty years was it not with them that had sinned whose carcases fell in the wilderness,b.HEB.3.17 (b.HEB.3.17) But (δὲ) with (NULL) whom (τίσιν) was (NULL) he (NULL) grieved (προσώχθισεν) forty (τεσσεράκοντα) years (ἔτη) was (NULL) it (NULL) not (οὐχὶ) with (NULL) them (τοῖς) that (NULL) had (NULL) sinned (ἁμαρτήσασιν) whose (ὧν) carcases (κῶλα) fell (ἔπεσεν) in (ἐν) the (τῇ) wilderness (ἐρήμῳ) 
b.HEB.3.18 And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest but to them that believed not,b.HEB.3.18 (b.HEB.3.18) And (δὲ) to (NULL) whom (τίσιν) sware (ὤμοσεν) he (NULL) that (NULL) they (NULL) should (NULL) not (μὴ) enter (εἰσελεύσεσθαι) into (εἰς) his (αὐτοῦ) rest (κατάπαυσιν) but (εἰ) to (NULL) them (τοῖς) that (NULL) believed (ἀπειθήσασιν) not (μὴ) 
b.HEB.3.19 So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief,b.HEB.3.19 (b.HEB.3.19) So (NULL) we (NULL) see (βλέπομεν) that (ὅτι) they (NULL) could (ἠδυνήθησαν) not (οὐκ) enter (εἰσελθεῖν) in (NULL) because (δι) of (NULL) unbelief (ἀπιστίαν) 
b.HEB.4.1 Let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it,b.HEB.4.1 (b.HEB.4.1) Let (Φοβηθῶμεν) us (NULL) therefore (οὖν) fear (καταλειπομένης) lest (μήποτε) a (NULL) promise (ἐπαγγελίας) being (NULL) left (εἰσελθεῖν) us (NULL) of (NULL) entering (δοκῇ) into (εἰς) his (αὐτοῦ) rest (κατάπαυσιν) any (τις) of (NULL) you (ὑμῶν) should (NULL) seem (ὑστερηκέναι) to (NULL) come (NULL) short (NULL) of (NULL) it (NULL) 
b.HEB.4.2 For unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it,b.HEB.4.2 (b.HEB.4.2) For (γάρ) unto (NULL) us (NULL) was (NULL) the (NULL) gospel (NULL) preached (NULL) as (καθάπερ) well (εὐηγγελισμένοι) as (καθάπερ) unto (NULL) them (τοῖς) but (ἀλλ) the (NULL) word (λόγος) preached (NULL) did (NULL) not (οὐκ) profit (NULL) them (τοῖς) not (οὐκ) being (τῆς) mixed (ἐκείνους) with (τῇ) faith (πίστει) in (NULL) them (τοῖς) that (NULL) heard (ἀκούσασιν) it (NULL) 
b.HEB.4.3 For we which have believed do enter into rest as he said As I have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world,b.HEB.4.3 (b.HEB.4.3) For (γὰρ) we (NULL) which (NULL) have (NULL) believed (πιστεύσαντες) do (οἱ) enter (εἰσερχόμεθα) into (εἰς) rest (κατάπαυσιν) as (καθὼς) he (NULL) said (εἴρηκεν) As (ὡς) I (NULL) have (NULL) sworn (ὤμοσα) in (ἐν) my (μου) wrath (ὀργῇ) if (εἰ) they (NULL) shall (NULL) enter (εἰσερχόμεθα) into (εἰς) my (μου) rest (κατάπαυσιν) although (καίτοι) the (τῶν) works (ἔργων) were (NULL) finished (γενηθέντων) from (ἀπὸ) the (τῶν) foundation (καταβολῆς) of (NULL) the (τῶν) world (κόσμου) 
b.HEB.4.4 For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise And God did rest the seventh day from all his works,b.HEB.4.4 (b.HEB.4.4) For (γάρ) he (NULL) spake (περὶ) in (NULL) a (NULL) certain (NULL) place (NULL) of (NULL) the (NULL) seventh (ἑβδόμης) day (NULL) on (ἐν) this (τῆς) wise (οὕτως) And (καὶ) God (θεὸς) did (NULL) rest (κατέπαυσεν) the (NULL) seventh (ἑβδόμης) day (NULL) from (ἀπὸ) all (πάντων) his (αὐτοῦ) works (ἔργων) 
b.HEB.4.5 And in this place again If they shall enter into my rest,b.HEB.4.5 (b.HEB.4.5) And (καὶ) in (ἐν) this (τούτῳ) place (NULL) again (πάλιν) If (NULL) they (NULL) shall (NULL) enter (NULL) into (NULL) my (NULL) rest (NULL) 
b.HEB.4.5 And in this place again If they shall enter into my rest,b.HEB.4.5 (b.HEB.4.5) And (καὶ) in (ἐν) this (τούτῳ) place (NULL) again (πάλιν) If (NULL) they (NULL) shall (NULL) enter (NULL) into (NULL) my (NULL) rest (NULL) 
b.HEB.4.6 Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief,b.HEB.4.6 (b.HEB.4.6) Seeing (ἐπεὶ) therefore (οὖν) it (NULL) remaineth (ἀπολείπεται) that (NULL) some (τινὰς) must (NULL) enter (εἰσελθεῖν) therein (αὐτήν) and (καὶ) they (οἱ) to (NULL) whom (NULL) it (NULL) was (NULL) first (πρότερον) preached (εὐαγγελισθέντες) entered (εἰσῆλθον) not (οὐκ) in (NULL) because (δι) of (NULL) unbelief (ἀπείθειαν) 
b.HEB.4.7 Again he limiteth a certain day saying in David To day after so long a time as it is said To day if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts,b.HEB.4.7 (b.HEB.4.7) Again (πάλιν) he (NULL) limiteth (ὁρίζει) a (NULL) certain (τινὰ) day (NULL) saying (λέγων) in (ἐν) David (Δαυεὶδ) To (NULL) day (NULL) after (μετὰ) so (τοσοῦτον) long (χρόνον) a (NULL) time (NULL) as (καθὼς) it (NULL) is (NULL) said (NULL) To (NULL) day (NULL) if (ἐὰν) ye (NULL) will (NULL) hear (ἀκούσητε) his (αὐτοῦ) voice (φωνῆς) harden (σκληρύνητε) not (μὴ) your (ὑμῶν) hearts (καρδίας) 
b.HEB.4.8 For if Jesus had given them rest then would he not afterward have spoken of another day,b.HEB.4.8 (b.HEB.4.8) For (γὰρ) if (εἰ) Jesus (Ἰησοῦς) had (NULL) given (NULL) them (αὐτοὺς) rest (κατέπαυσεν) then (NULL) would (ἂν) he (NULL) not (οὐκ) afterward (NULL) have (NULL) spoken (περὶ) of (NULL) another (ἄλλης) day (ἡμέρας) 
b.HEB.4.9 There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God,b.HEB.4.9 (b.HEB.4.9) There (NULL) remaineth (ἀπολείπεται) therefore (NULL) a (NULL) rest (σαββατισμὸς) to (τῷ) the (NULL) people (λαῷ) of (τοῦ) God (θεοῦ) 
b.HEB.4.10 For he that is entered into his rest he also hath ceased from his own works as God did from his,b.HEB.4.10 (b.HEB.4.10) For (γὰρ) he (NULL) that (NULL) is (NULL) entered (εἰσελθὼν) into (εἰς) his (αὐτοῦ) rest (κατάπαυσιν) he (NULL) also (καὶ) hath (NULL) ceased (κατέπαυσεν) from (ἀπὸ) his (αὐτοῦ) own (ἰδίων) works (ἔργων) as (ὥσπερ) God (θεός) did (NULL) from (ἀπὸ) his (αὐτοῦ) 
b.HEB.4.11 Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief,b.HEB.4.11 (b.HEB.4.11) Let (σπουδάσωμεν) us (NULL) labour (NULL) therefore (οὖν) to (NULL) enter (εἰσελθεῖν) into (εἰς) that (NULL) rest (κατάπαυσιν) lest (ἵνα) any (τις) man (NULL) fall (πέσῃ) after (NULL) the (NULL) same (NULL) example (ὑποδείγματι) of (τῆς) unbelief (ἀπειθείας) 
b.HEB.4.12 For the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any twoedged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart,b.HEB.4.12 (b.HEB.4.12) For (γὰρ) the (ὁ) word (λόγος) of (τοῦ) God (θεοῦ) is (NULL) quick (ζῶν) and (καὶ) powerful (ἐνεργὴς) and (καὶ) sharper (τομώτερος) than (ὑπὲρ) any (NULL) twoedged (NULL) sword (μάχαιραν) piercing (δίστομον) even (καὶ) to (NULL) the (ὁ) dividing (διϊκνούμενος) asunder (μερισμοῦ) of (τοῦ) soul (ψυχῆς) and (καὶ) spirit (πνεύματος) and (καὶ) of (τοῦ) the (ὁ) joints (NULL) and (καὶ) marrow (NULL) and (καὶ) is (NULL) a (NULL) discerner (NULL) of (τοῦ) the (ὁ) thoughts (ἐνθυμήσεων) and (καὶ) intents (ἐννοιῶν) of (τοῦ) the (ὁ) heart (καρδίας) 
b.HEB.4.13 Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do,b.HEB.4.13 (b.HEB.4.13) Neither (NULL) is (NULL) there (καὶ) any (NULL) creature (κτίσις) that (NULL) is (NULL) not (οὐκ) manifest (ἀφανὴς) in (NULL) his (αὐτοῦ) sight (ἐνώπιον) but (δὲ) all (πάντα) things (NULL) are (NULL) naked (γυμνὰ) and (καὶ) opened (τετραχηλισμένα) unto (τοῖς) the (NULL) eyes (ὀφθαλμοῖς) of (NULL) him (αὐτοῦ) with (NULL) whom (NULL) we (NULL) have (NULL) to (NULL) do (NULL) 
b.HEB.4.13 Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do,b.HEB.4.13 (b.HEB.4.13) Neither (NULL) is (NULL) there (καὶ) any (NULL) creature (κτίσις) that (NULL) is (NULL) not (οὐκ) manifest (ἀφανὴς) in (NULL) his (αὐτοῦ) sight (ἐνώπιον) but (δὲ) all (πάντα) things (NULL) are (NULL) naked (γυμνὰ) and (καὶ) opened (τετραχηλισμένα) unto (τοῖς) the (NULL) eyes (ὀφθαλμοῖς) of (NULL) him (αὐτοῦ) with (NULL) whom (NULL) we (NULL) have (NULL) to (NULL) do (NULL) 
b.HEB.4.14 Seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens Jesus the Son of God let us hold fast our profession,b.HEB.4.14 (b.HEB.4.14) Seeing (ἔχοντες) then (οὖν) that (NULL) we (NULL) have (NULL) a (NULL) great (μέγαν) high (ἀρχιερέα) priest (NULL) that (NULL) is (NULL) passed (NULL) into (διεληλυθότα) the (τοὺς) heavens (οὐρανούς) Jesus (Ἰησοῦν) the (τοὺς) Son (υἱὸν) of (τοῦ) God (θεοῦ) let (NULL) us (NULL) hold (κρατῶμεν) fast (NULL) our (NULL) profession (ὁμολογίας) 
b.HEB.4.15 For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin,b.HEB.4.15 (b.HEB.4.15) For (γὰρ) we (ἔχομεν) have (NULL) not (μὴ) an (δυνάμενον) high (ἀρχιερέα) priest (NULL) which (NULL) cannot (NULL) be (NULL) touched (συνπαθῆσαι) with (ταῖς) the (NULL) feeling (ἀσθενείαις) of (NULL) our (ἡμῶν) infirmities (πεπειρασμένον) but (δὲ) was (NULL) in (κατὰ) all (πάντα) points (καθ) tempted (ὁμοιότητα) like (NULL) as (NULL) we (ἔχομεν) are (NULL) yet (NULL) without (χωρὶς) sin (ἁμαρτίας) 
b.HEB.4.16 Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need,b.HEB.4.16 (b.HEB.4.16) Let (προσερχώμεθα) us (NULL) therefore (οὖν) come (NULL) boldly (παρρησίας) unto (τῷ) the (NULL) throne (θρόνῳ) of (τῆς) grace (χάριτος) that (NULL) we (NULL) may (ἵνα) obtain (λάβωμεν) mercy (ἔλεος) and (καὶ) find (εὕρωμεν) grace (χάριτος) to (εἰς) help (εὔκαιρον) in (NULL) time (NULL) of (τῆς) need (βοήθειαν) 
b.HEB.5.1 For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins,b.HEB.5.1 (b.HEB.5.1) For (γὰρ) every (Πᾶς) high (ἀρχιερεὺς) priest (NULL) taken (NULL) from (ἐξ) among (NULL) men (ἀνθρώπων) is (NULL) ordained (λαμβανόμενος) for (ὑπὲρ) men (ἀνθρώπων) in (NULL) things (τὰ) pertaining (καθίσταται) to (πρὸς) God (θεόν) that (NULL) he (NULL) may (ἵνα) offer (προσφέρῃ) both (τε) gifts (δῶρά) and (καὶ) sacrifices (θυσίας) for (ὑπὲρ) sins (ἁμαρτιῶν) 
b.HEB.5.2 Who can have compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity,b.HEB.5.2 (b.HEB.5.2) Who (NULL) can (μετριοπαθεῖν) have (NULL) compassion (ἀγνοοῦσιν) on (NULL) the (NULL) ignorant (NULL) and (καὶ) on (NULL) them (τοῖς) that (NULL) are (NULL) out (NULL) of (NULL) the (NULL) way (NULL) for (NULL) that (NULL) he (NULL) himself (αὐτὸς) also (καὶ) is (NULL) compassed (περίκειται) with (NULL) infirmity (ἀσθένειαν) 
b.HEB.5.3 And by reason hereof he ought as for the people so also for himself to offer for sins,b.HEB.5.3 (b.HEB.5.3) And (καὶ) by (δι) reason (NULL) hereof (αὐτὴν) he (NULL) ought (ὀφείλει) as (καθὼς) for (περὶ) the (τοῦ) people (λαοῦ) so (οὕτως) also (καὶ) for (περὶ) himself (ἑαυτοῦ) to (NULL) offer (προσφέρειν) for (περὶ) sins (ἁμαρτιῶν)

b.HEB.9.28 So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation,b.HEB.9.28 (b.HEB.9.28) So (οὕτως) Christ (Χριστός) was (NULL) once (ἅπαξ) offered (προσενεχθεὶς) to (εἰς) bear (NULL) the (τὸ) sins (ἁμαρτίας) of (ἐκ) many (πολλῶν) and (καὶ) unto (τοῖς) them (ἀνενεγκεῖν) that (NULL) look (ὀφθήσεται) for (NULL) him (αὐτὸν) shall (NULL) he (NULL) appear (ἀπεκδεχομένοις) the (τὸ) second (δευτέρου) time (NULL) without (χωρὶς) sin (ἁμαρτίας) unto (τοῖς) salvation (σωτηρίαν)
