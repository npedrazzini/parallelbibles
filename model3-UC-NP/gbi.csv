b.HEB.4.2 For unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it,b.HEB.4.2 (b.HEB.4.2) For (Sababu) unto (NULL) us (ngone) was (NULL) the (o) gospel (habari) preached (NULL) as (ka) well (poiseka) as (ka) unto (NULL) them (ona) but (Duma) the (o) word (NULL) preached (NULL) did (NULL) not (NULL) profit (ihiwa) them (ona) not (NULL) being (so) mixed (yoiiseka) with (NULL) faith (NULL) in (NULL) them (ona) that (gena) heard (NULL) it (magena)
