b.HEB.3.17 But with whom was he grieved forty years was it not with them that had sinned whose carcases fell in the wilderness,b.HEB.3.17 (b.HEB.3.17) But (NULL) with (NULL) whom (ܘܒܐܝܠܝܢ) was (NULL) he (ܠܗ) grieved (ܡܐܢܬ) forty (ܐܪܒܥܝܢ) years (ܫܢܝܢ) was (NULL) it (NULL) not (ܐܠܐ) with (NULL) them (ܒܗܢܘܢ) that (NULL) had (NULL) sinned (ܕܚܛܘ) whose (NULL) carcases (ܘܓܪܡܝܗܘܢ) fell (ܢܦܠܘ) in (NULL) the (NULL) wilderness (ܒܡܕܒܪܐ)

b.HEB.3.19 So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief,b.HEB.3.19 (b.HEB.3.19) So (NULL) we (NULL) see (ܘܚܙܝܢܢ) that (NULL) they (NULL) could (ܐܫܟܚܘ) not (ܕܠܐ) enter (ܠܡܥܠ) in (NULL) because (ܡܛܠ) of (NULL) unbelief (ܗܝܡܢܘ)

b.HEB.4.2 For unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it,b.HEB.4.2 (b.HEB.4.2) For (ܓܝܪ) unto (NULL) us (NULL) was (NULL) the (NULL) gospel (ܐܤܬܒܪܢ) preached (NULL) as (ܐܝܟ) well (NULL) as (ܐܝܟ) unto (NULL) them (ܗܢܘܢ) but (ܐܠܐ) the (NULL) word (ܡܠܬܐ) preached (NULL) did (NULL) not (ܠܐ) profit (ܐܘܬܪܬ) them (ܗܢܘܢ) not (ܠܐ) being (NULL) mixed (ܡܡܙܓܐ) with (NULL) faith (ܒܗܝܡܢܘܬܐ) in (NULL) them (ܗܢܘܢ) that (NULL) heard (ܕܫܡܥܘ) it (ܕܫܡܥܘܗ)

b.HEB.4.6 Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief,b.HEB.4.6 (b.HEB.4.6) Seeing (ܕܐܝܬ) therefore (ܗܟܝܠ) it (NULL) remaineth (NULL) that (NULL) some (NULL) must (NULL) enter (ܢܥܘܠ) therein (NULL) and (NULL) they (ܘܗܢܘܢ) to (NULL) whom (NULL) it (NULL) was (NULL) first (ܩܕܡܝܐ) preached (ܕܐܤܬܒܪܘ) entered (ܥܠܘ) not (ܠܐ) in (NULL) because (ܒܕܠܐ) of (NULL) unbelief (ܐܬܛܦܝܤܘ) 
b.HEB.4.7 Again he limiteth a certain day saying in David To day after so long a time as it is said To day if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts,b.HEB.4.7 (b.HEB.4.7) Again (ܬܘܒ) he (NULL) limiteth (ܡܢ) a (NULL) certain (NULL) day (ܝܘܡܐ) saying (ܕܐܡܪ) in (NULL) David (ܕܘܝܕ) To (NULL) day (ܝܘܡܐ) after (ܒܬܪ) so (NULL) long (ܤܓܝܐܐ) a (NULL) time (ܙܒܢܐ) as (ܐܝܟܢܐ) it (NULL) is (ܟܬܝܒ) said (NULL) To (NULL) day (ܝܘܡܐ) if (ܐܢ) ye (NULL) will (ܒܩܠܗ) hear (NULL) his (NULL) voice (ܬܫܡܥܘܢ) harden (ܬܩܫܘܢ) not (ܠܐ) your (NULL) hearts (ܠܒܘܬܟܘܢ) 
b.HEB.4.8 For if Jesus had given them rest then would he not afterward have spoken of another day,b.HEB.4.8 (b.HEB.4.8) For (ܓܝܪ) if (ܐܠܘ) Jesus (ܝܫܘܥ) had (ܗܘܐ) given (NULL) them (ܐܢܘܢ) rest (NULL) then (ܢܘܢ) would (ܐܢܝܚ) he (ܐܡܪ) not (ܠܐ) afterward (ܒܬܪܟܢ) have (NULL) spoken (NULL) of (ܥܠ) another (ܐܚܪܢܐ) day (ܝܘܡܐ) 
b.HEB.4.9 There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God,b.HEB.4.9 (b.HEB.4.9) There (NULL) remaineth (NULL) therefore (ܩܝܡ) a (NULL) rest (ܠܡܫܒܬܘ) to (NULL) the (NULL) people (ܠܥܡܗ) of (NULL) God (ܕܐܠܗܐ) 
b.HEB.4.10 For he that is entered into his rest he also hath ceased from his own works as God did from his,b.HEB.4.10 (b.HEB.4.10) For (ܓܝܪ) he (ܐܝܢܐ) that (NULL) is (NULL) entered (NULL) into (NULL) his (NULL) rest (ܠܢܝܚܬܗ) he (ܐܝܢܐ) also (ܐܦ) hath (NULL) ceased (ܐܬܬܢܝܚ) from (ܡܢ) his (NULL) own (ܕܝܠܗ) works (ܥܒܕܘܗܝ) as (ܐܝܟ) God (ܕܐܠܗܐ) did (NULL) from (ܡܢ) his (NULL) 
b.HEB.4.11 Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief,b.HEB.4.11 (b.HEB.4.11) Let (NULL) us (NULL) labour (ܢܬܚܦܛ) therefore (ܗܟܝܠ) to (NULL) enter (ܕܢܥܘܠ) into (NULL) that (NULL) rest (ܢܝܚܬܐ) lest (ܕܠܐ) any (NULL) man (NULL) fall (ܢܦܠ) after (ܕܗܢܘܢ) the (NULL) same (NULL) example (ܒܕܡܘܬܐ) of (NULL) unbelief (ܐܬܛܦܝܤܘ) 
b.HEB.4.12 For the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any twoedged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart,b.HEB.4.12 (b.HEB.4.12) For (ܓܝܪ) the (NULL) word (ܡܠܬܗ) of (NULL) God (ܕܐܠܗܐ) is (ܗܝ) quick (NULL) and (NULL) powerful (ܘܟܠ) and (NULL) sharper (ܘܚܪܝܦܐ) than (ܡܢ) any (NULL) twoedged (ܤܦܤܪܐ) sword (NULL) piercing (ܕܬܪܝܢ) even (NULL) to (ܥܕܡܐ) the (NULL) dividing (ܠܦܘܪܫܢܐ) asunder (ܕܢܦܫܐ) of (NULL) soul (NULL) and (NULL) spirit (ܘܕܪܘܚܐ) and (NULL) of (NULL) the (NULL) joints (ܘܕܫܪܝܬܐ) and (NULL) marrow (ܘܕܡܘܚܐ) and (NULL) is (ܗܝ) a (ܘܕܓܪܡܐ) discerner (ܘܕܝܢܐ) of (NULL) the (NULL) thoughts (ܡܚܫܒܬܐ) and (NULL) intents (ܘܬܪܥܝܬܐ) of (NULL) the (NULL) heart (ܕܠܒܐ) 
b.HEB.4.13 Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do,b.HEB.4.13 (b.HEB.4.13) Neither (ܕܛܫܝܐ) is (NULL) there (NULL) any (ܡܢ) creature (ܒܪܝܬܐ) that (NULL) is (NULL) not (ܩܕܡܝܗ) manifest (ܘܓܠܐ) in (NULL) his (NULL) sight (ܩܕܡ) but (ܐܠܐ) all (ܟܠ) things (ܡܕܡ) are (NULL) naked (ܥܪܛܠ) and (NULL) opened (NULL) unto (NULL) the (NULL) eyes (ܥܝܢܘܗܝ) of (NULL) him (NULL) with (NULL) whom (ܕܠܗ) we (NULL) have (ܘܠܝܬ) to (NULL) do (ܝܗܒܝܢܢ)

b.HEB.4.15 For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin,b.HEB.4.15 (b.HEB.4.15) For (ܓܝܪ) we (ܠܢ) have (ܐܝܬ) not (ܠܐ) an (NULL) high (NULL) priest (ܪܒܟܘܡܪܐ) which (NULL) cannot (ܕܠܐ) be (NULL) touched (ܡܨܐ) with (ܥܡ) the (NULL) feeling (ܟܪܝܗܘܬܢ) of (ܡܢ) our (NULL) infirmities (NULL) but (ܐܠܐ) was (ܕܡܢܤܝ) in (NULL) all (ܒܟܠܡܕܡ) points (ܐܟܘܬܢ) tempted (ܤܛܪ) like (NULL) as (NULL) we (ܠܢ) are (NULL) yet (NULL) without (NULL) sin (ܚܛܝܬܐ)
