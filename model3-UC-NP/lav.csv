b.HEB.4.2 For unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it,b.HEB.4.2 (b.HEB.4.2) For (Jo) unto (NULL) us (mums) was (tika) the (NULL) gospel (NULL) preached (pasludināts) as (tāpat) well (NULL) as (tāpat) unto (NULL) them (viņiem) but (bet) the (NULL) word (vārds) preached (pasludināts) did (NULL) not (nekā) profit (nelīdzēja) them (viņiem) not (nekā) being (NULL) mixed (nesavienoja) with (ar) faith (ticību) in (NULL) them (viņiem) that (kas) heard (dzirdēja) it (NULL)

b.HEB.4.15 For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin,b.HEB.4.15 (b.HEB.4.15) For (Jo) we (mums) have (NULL) not (nav) an (NULL) high (augstā) priest (priestera) which (kas) cannot (nespētu) be (NULL) touched (NULL) with (NULL) the (NULL) feeling (līdzjust) of (NULL) our (mūsu) infirmities (vājībām) but (bet) was (NULL) in (kas) all (visās) points (lietās) tempted (kārdināts) like (tāpat) as (NULL) we (mums) are (NULL) yet (NULL) without (bez) sin (grēka)
