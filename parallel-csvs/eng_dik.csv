b.HEB.9.7,"But into the second went the high priest alone once every year , not without blood , which he offered for himself , and for the errors of the people : ",b.HEB.9.7,"ku keemɔ biak wen ee kekiou yen aye bɛnydiit tueŋ e ka ke Nhialic lɔ thin , yen etok , raantok e run tokic , ku acie lɔ thin te cin riɛm , riɛm ee lɔ gam Nhialic ne kede guop , ku ne kede ka ci kɔc wooo ke kucki rot .

b.HEB.9.8,"The Holy Ghost this signifying , that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest , while as the first tabernacle was yet standing : ",b.HEB.9.8,"Yen aye Weidit Ɣer kɔc nyuoth cooke , yan , Kueer lɔ teɣeric ewic aŋoot ke kene tɔ tiec , te ŋoote keemɔ tueŋ ke kaac . "

b.HEB.9.11,"But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come , by a greater and more perfect tabernacle , not made with hands , that is to say , not of this building ; ",b.HEB.9.11,"Na wen , ke Kritho bɔ ke ye bɛnydiit tueŋ e ka ke Nhialic bɛny de kapiɛth bi bɛn , ne keemɔ ŋuan nyin , ku ci dikedik awar keemɔ waan , ku aa cii cuec e raan cin , tharde ki , an , acie kede caŋe , "
b.HEB.9.12,"Neither by the blood of goats and calves , but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place , having obtained eternal redemption for us .

b.HEB.9.13,"For if the blood of bulls and of goats , and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean , sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh : ",b.HEB.9.13,"Ku riɛm de thok bɔɔth ku mioor , keke arom de dau , te ci ke pɔɔr e kɔc gup kɔc ci wook e kecol , ago ke tɔ piɛth gup : "
b.HEB.9.14,"How much more shall the blood of Christ , who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God , purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God ? ",b.HEB.9.14,"na riɛm de Kritho raan ci ro gam Nhialic ke cin guop tethiin col , ne Weidit e tɔu athɛɛr , bi keek woor e war yindi ne wɛk bi en week waak piɔth ne luɔi ci thou , abi cien ke ŋiɛcki rot , ke we bi ka ke Nhialic piir aa looi ?

b.HEB.9.15,"And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament , that by means of death , for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament , they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance . ",b.HEB.9.15,"Yen aye yen raan e kɔc maat ku ye caatɔ de loŋ ci piac mac , ago ka ci kɔc wooc cool ne thon ci en thou , kɔc rɛɛr e loŋ ci kɔn mac tueŋic , ke kɔc ci cɔɔl ke ke bi ke ci kɔn lueel lɔɔk lak , ke bi tɔu athɛɛr .

b.HEB.9.17,For a testament is of force after men are dead : otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth . ,b.HEB.9.17,"Awarek de teŋ de weu ade naamde te ci raan guɔ thou : ku na ken raan thou , ke awarek acin naamde anande te ŋoote raan e gaar en ke piir . "
b.HEB.9.18,Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood . ,b.HEB.9.18,Yen akene loŋ ci mac tueŋ cak thar aya te cin riɛm . 
b.HEB.9.19,"For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law , he took the blood of calves and of goats , with water , and scarlet wool , and hyssop , and sprinkled both the book , and all the people , ",b.HEB.9.19,"Ku te ci Mothe kɔc kedhie lɛk cok ke loŋ ebɛn ne kede loŋ , ke jɔ riɛm de mioor ku thok bɔɔth noom , keke piu ku nhim ke thok nhim thith ku wɛɛl cɔl kithop , go ke wieeth e awarek kɔu ku wiith ke e kɔc gup kedhie aya , "

b.HEB.9.21,"Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle , and all the vessels of the ministry . ",b.HEB.9.21,"Ku jɔ riɛm wieeth e keemɔ kɔu e wiith awen , ku wiith e tony kɔɔth kedhie aya tony ke luɔi de Nhialic . "
b.HEB.9.22,And almost all things are by the law purged with blood ; and without shedding of blood is no remission . ,b.HEB.9.22,"Ku ne kede loŋ tedit e kaŋ kedhie ayeke tɔ ɣer yiic ne riɛm , adɔŋ tokiook tei , ku te cin lɛu e riɛm ka cin pal e karac . "
b.HEB.9.23,It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these ; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these . ,b.HEB.9.23,Ku ka ci looi ka cit ka nu paannhial aake ye dhil tɔ ɣer yiic ne kake ; ku ka nu paannhial gup ayeke dhil tɔ ɣer yiic ne kapiɛth ci nɔk ka war ekake . 
b.HEB.9.24,"For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands , which are the figures of the true ; but into heaven itself , now to appear in the presence of God for us : ",b.HEB.9.24,"Ku Kritho aken lɔ teɣeric ci looi e kɔc cin , ee ke cit teɣeric yic tei ; ee paannhial guop en aa le en thin , le ku tic e Nhialic nɔm ne biakda enɔɔne : "
b.HEB.9.25,"Nor yet that he should offer himself often , as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others ; ",b.HEB.9.25,"ku acie luɔi bi en ro gaam raanjuec ; cit man ee bɛnydiit tueŋ e ka ke Nhialic lɔ thin e run nyiin , ke muk riɛm cie kede ; "
b.HEB.9.26,For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world : but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself . ,b.HEB.9.26,"na ci looi aya , ka di ci aa cool e gum kaŋ raanjuec te ɣɔn ciɛke piny : ku enɔɔne aci ro nyuɔɔth raantok ne thok de piny , bi kerac bɛn nyaai ne naŋ ci e nɔk .

b.HEB.9.27,"And as it is appointed unto men once to die , but after this the judgment : ",b.HEB.9.27,"Ku acit man ci loŋ taau piny , an , bi kɔc thou raantok , ku bi guieereloŋ jɔ lɔɔk bɛn ; "
b.HEB.9.28,So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many ; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation . ,b.HEB.9.28,"ayi Kritho aya , te ci en rot gaam raantok bi karɛc ke kɔc juec bɛn jɔt , ka bi bɛ tic e renden tede kɔc tit en , ke cin kerɛɛc cath ke yen , ne kuny bi en ke kony wei .

b.HEB.10.1,"For the law having a shadow of good things to come , and not the very image of the things , can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect . ",b.HEB.10.1,"Ku loŋ , luɔi ciɛth en keke atiep de kapiɛth bi bɛn tei , ku cie cath ke guop de kaŋ gup , ka cii kɔc dueer tɔ ye piɔth dikedik ananden , kɔc e ro cuɔt tethiɔk , ne ka yek cool e lɛm kek ke ku nakki keek e run nyiin ebɛn .

b.HEB.10.2,For then would they not have ceased to be offered ? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins . ,b.HEB.10.2,"Ka di keneke pɔl e lam ? Kɔc e lam , tee ke ci tɔ ɣer piɔth raan tok , ka di cin ŋiny de karɛc ci doŋ e kepiɔth . "
b.HEB.10.3,But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year . ,b.HEB.10.3,"Ku naŋ e ye kake nɔk , yen aye kɔc keniim tak e karɛcken e run nyiin kedhie . "
b.HEB.10.4,For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins . ,b.HEB.10.4,Riɛm de mioor ku thok bɔɔth aciki karac dueer leu ne nyiɛɛi . 
b.HEB.10.5,"Wherefore when he cometh into the world , he saith , Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not , but a body hast thou prepared me : ",b.HEB.10.5,"Yen a lueel en en , te bi en e piny nɔm , yan , Naŋ de kaŋ ku gɛm e kaŋ aake kɛne ya kɔɔr , Ee guop yen aa cueec yin ɛn ; "

b.HEB.10.10,By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all . ,b.HEB.10.10,"Ku e kede piɔn e Nhialice , en aa tɔ wo ɣerpiɔth ne gam ci guop de Yecu Kritho gaam raantok ku jɔ thok . "
b.HEB.10.11,"And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices , which can never take away sins : ",b.HEB.10.11,"Ku bɛny de ka ke Nhialic ebɛn ee kɔɔc e akool nyiin ke loi luɔide ku ye cool e lam kamanke ka bi nɔk , ka cii karac dueer leu e nyiɛɛi ananden . "
b.HEB.10.12,"But this man , after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever , sat down on the right hand of God ; ",b.HEB.10.12,"Ku raane , te ci en toŋ ci nɔk e baŋ de karac gaam ke bi dɛ naamde athɛɛr , ke jɔ nyuc e ciin cueny de Nhialic ; "
