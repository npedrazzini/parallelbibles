b.HEB.9.16,"For where a testament is , there must also of necessity be the death of the testator . ",b.HEB.9.16,"Aissi giikko , haiqqiya urai azazidobai de7ikko , he urai haiqqidoogee erettana koshshees . "
b.HEB.9.17,For a testament is of force after men are dead : otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth . ,b.HEB.9.17,"Aissi giikko , azazida urai haiqqido wode , i azazidoogee polettees ; he azazidaagee paxa de7ishin , ainne polettenna . "

b.HEB.9.19,"For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law , he took the blood of calves and of goats , with water , and scarlet wool , and hyssop , and sprinkled both the book , and all the people , ",b.HEB.9.19,"Aissi giikko , higgiyan de7iya azazo ubbaa Muusee asa ubbau yootiis ; hegaappe guyyiyan , galo maraa suuttaanne deeshshaa suuttaa , haattaara , zo7o dorssa ikisiyaaranne hiisoophphiyaa giyo mittaa bonccuwaara issippe ekkidi , “ Hagee inttena Xoossai azazido maachchaa suuttaa ” yaagidi , higgiyaa maxaafaa bollinne asa ubbaa bolli caccafiis .

b.HEB.9.23,It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these ; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these . ,b.HEB.9.23,"Hegaa gishshau , saluwan de7iyaageeta milatiyaageeti he yarshshuwan geeyanau koshshees ; shin saluwan de7iyaageetikka bantta huuphen geeyanau aadhdhiya yarshshuwaa eta koshshees .

b.HEB.9.24,"For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands , which are the figures of the true ; but into heaven itself , now to appear in the presence of God for us : ",b.HEB.9.24,"Aissi giikko , Kiristtoosi tumu geeshshasan leemisettiya asi oottido geeshshasaa gelibeenna ; shin i ha77i nu gishshaa Xoossaa sinttan beettanau yaa saluwaa geliis .

b.HEB.9.26,For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world : but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself . ,b.HEB.9.26,"Hegaa gidiyaakko , Kiristtoosi sa7ai merettoosappe doommidi darotoo waayettanau koshshees ; shin ha77i wodiyaa wurssettan nagaraa xaissanau bana yarshshidi , naa77anttennan issitoo beettiis .

b.HEB.10.1,"For the law having a shadow of good things to come , and not the very image of the things , can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect .
