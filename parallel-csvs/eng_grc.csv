b.MAT.13.3,"And he spake many things unto them in parables , saying , Behold , a sower went forth to sow ; ",b.MAT.13.3,καὶ ἐλάλησεν αὐτοῖς πολλὰ ἐν παραβολαῖς λέγων ἰδοὺ ἐξῆλθεν ὁ σπείρων τοῦ σπείρειν 
b.MAT.13.4,"And when he sowed , some seeds fell by the way side , and the fowls came and devoured them up : ",b.MAT.13.4,καὶ ἐν τῷ σπείρειν αὐτὸν ἃ μὲν ἔπεσεν παρὰ τὴν ὁδόν καὶ ἦλθεν τὰ πετεινὰ καὶ κατέφαγεν αὐτά 
b.MAT.13.5,"Some fell upon stony places , where they had not much earth : and forthwith they sprung up , because they had no deepness of earth : ",b.MAT.13.5,ἄλλα δὲ ἔπεσεν ἐπὶ τὰ πετρώδη ὅπου οὐκ εἶχεν γῆν πολλήν καὶ εὐθέως ἐξανέτειλεν διὰ τὸ μὴ ἔχειν βάθος γῆς

b.MAT.13.11,"He answered and said unto them , Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven , but to them it is not given . ",b.MAT.13.11,ὁ δὲ ἀποκριθεὶς εἶπεν ὅτι ὑμῖν δέδοται γνῶναι τὰ μυστήρια τῆς βασιλείας τῶν οὐρανῶν ἐκείνοις δὲ οὐ δέδοται

b.MAT.13.15,"For this people ' s heart is waxed gross , and their ears are dull of hearing , and their eyes they have closed ; lest at any time they should see with their eyes , and hear with their ears , and should understand with their heart , and should be converted , and I should heal them .

b.MAT.13.18,Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower . ,b.MAT.13.18,ὑμεῖς οὖν ἀκούσατε τὴν παραβολὴν τοῦ σπείραντος 
b.MAT.13.19,"When any one heareth the word of the kingdom , and understandeth it not , then cometh the wicked one , and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart . This is he which received seed by the way side .

b.MAT.13.20,"But he that received the seed into stony places , the same is he that heareth the word , and anon with joy receiveth it ; ",b.MAT.13.20,ὁ δὲ ἐπὶ τὰ πετρώδη σπαρείς οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ τὸν λόγον ἀκούων καὶ εὐθὺς μετὰ χαρᾶς λαμβάνων αὐτόν 
b.MAT.13.21,"Yet hath he not root in himself , but dureth for a while : for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word , by and by he is offended . ",b.MAT.13.21,οὐκ ἔχει δὲ ῥίζαν ἐν ἑαυτῷ ἀλλὰ πρόσκαιρός ἐστιν γενομένης δὲ θλίψεως ἢ διωγμοῦ διὰ τὸν λόγον εὐθὺς σκανδαλίζεται 
b.MAT.13.22,"He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word ; and the care of this world , and the deceitfulness of riches , choke the word , and he becometh unfruitful . ",b.MAT.13.22,ὁ δὲ εἰς τὰς ἀκάνθας σπαρείς οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ τὸν λόγον ἀκούων καὶ ἡ μέριμνα τοῦ αἰῶνος καὶ ἡ ἀπάτη τοῦ πλούτου συμπνίγει τὸν λόγον καὶ ἄκαρπος γίνεται 
b.MAT.13.23,"But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word , and understandeth it ; which also beareth fruit , and bringeth forth , some an hundredfold , some sixty , some thirty .

b.MAT.13.24,"Another parable put he forth unto them , saying , The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field : ",b.MAT.13.24,Ἄλλην παραβολὴν παρέθηκεν αὐτοῖς λέγων ὡμοιώθη ἡ βασιλεία τῶν οὐρανῶν ἀνθρώπῳ σπείραντι καλὸν σπέρμα ἐν τῷ ἀγρῷ αὐτοῦ 
b.MAT.13.25,"But while men slept , his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat , and went his way . ",b.MAT.13.25,ἐν δὲ τῷ καθεύδειν τοὺς ἀνθρώπους ἦλθεν αὐτοῦ ὁ ἐχθρὸς καὶ ἐπέσπειρεν ζιζάνια ἀνὰ μέσον τοῦ σίτου καὶ ἀπῆλθεν 
b.MAT.13.26,"But when the blade was sprung up , and brought forth fruit , then appeared the tares also . ",b.MAT.13.26,ὅτε δὲ ἐβλάστησεν ὁ χόρτος καὶ καρπὸν ἐποίησεν τότε ἐφάνη καὶ τὰ ζιζάνια 
b.MAT.13.27,"So the servants of the householder came and said unto him , Sir , didst not thou sow good seed in thy field ? from whence then hath it tares ? ",b.MAT.13.27,προσελθόντες δὲ οἱ δοῦλοι τοῦ οἰκοδεσπότου εἶπον αὐτῷ κύριε οὐχὶ καλὸν σπέρμα ἔσπειρας ἐν τῷ σῷ ἀγρῷ πόθεν οὖν ἔχει ζιζάνια 
b.MAT.13.28,"He said unto them , An enemy hath done this . The servants said unto him , Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up ? ",b.MAT.13.28,ὁ δὲ ἔφη αὐτοῖς ἐχθρὸς ἄνθρωπος τοῦτο ἐποίησεν οἱ δὲ δοῦλοι λέγουσιν αὐτῷ θέλεις οὖν ἀπελθόντες συλλέξωμεν αὐτά 
b.MAT.13.29,"But he said , Nay ; lest while ye gather up the tares , ye root up also the wheat with them . ",b.MAT.13.29,ὁ δέ φησίν οὔ μήποτε συλλέγοντες τὰ ζιζάνια ἐκριζώσητε ἅμα αὐτοῖς τὸν σῖτον 
b.MAT.13.30,"Let both grow together until the harvest : and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers , Gather ye together first the tares , and bind them in bundles to burn them : but gather the wheat into my barn . ",b.MAT.13.30,ἄφετε συναυξάνεσθαι ἀμφότερα μέχρι τοῦ θερισμοῦ καὶ ἐν καιρῷ τοῦ θερισμοῦ ἐρῶ τοῖς θερισταῖς συλλέξατε πρῶτον τὰ ζιζάνια καὶ δήσατε αὐτὰ εἰς δέσμας πρὸς τὸ κατακαῦσαι αὐτά τὸν δὲ σῖτον συναγάγετε εἰς τὴν ἀποθήκην μου 
b.MAT.13.31,"Another parable put he forth unto them , saying , The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed , which a man took , and sowed in his field : ",b.MAT.13.31,Ἄλλην παραβολὴν παρέθηκεν αὐτοῖς λέγων ὁμοία ἐστὶν ἡ βασιλεία τῶν οὐρανῶν κόκκῳ σινάπεως ὃν λαβὼν ἄνθρωπος ἔσπειρεν ἐν τῷ ἀγρῷ αὐτοῦ 
b.MAT.13.32,"Which indeed is the least of all seeds : but when it is grown , it is the greatest among herbs , and becometh a tree , so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof . ",b.MAT.13.32,ὃ μικρότερον μέν ἐστιν πάντων τῶν σπερμάτων ὅταν δὲ αὐξηθῇ μεῖζον τῶν λαχάνων ἐστὶν καὶ γίνεται δένδρον ὥστε ἐλθεῖν τὰ πετεινὰ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ κατασκηνοῦν ἐν τοῖς κλάδοις αὐτοῦ 
b.MAT.13.33,"Another parable spake he unto them ; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven , which a woman took , and hid in three measures of meal , till the whole was leavened . ",b.MAT.13.33,Ἄλλην παραβολὴν ἐλάλησεν αὐτοῖς ὁμοία ἐστὶν ἡ βασιλεία τῶν οὐρανῶν ζύμῃ ἣν λαβοῦσα γυνὴ ἐνέκρυψεν εἰς ἀλεύρου σάτα τρία ἕως οὗ ἐζυμώθη ὅλον 
b.MAT.13.34,All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables ; and without a parable spake he not unto them : ,b.MAT.13.34,Ταῦτα πάντα ἐλάλησεν ὁ Ἰησοῦς ἐν παραβολαῖς τοῖς ὄχλοις καὶ χωρὶς παραβολῆς οὐδὲν ἐλάλει αὐτοῖς 
b.MAT.13.35,"That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet , saying , I will open my mouth in parables ; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world . ",b.MAT.13.35,ὅπως πληρωθῇ τὸ ῥηθὲν διὰ τοῦ προφήτου Ἡσαίου λέγοντος ἀνοίξω ἐν παραβολαῖς τὸ στόμα μου ἐρεύξομαι κεκρυμμένα ἀπὸ καταβολῆς 
b.MAT.13.36,"Then Jesus sent the multitude away , and went into the house : and his disciples came unto him , saying , Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field . ",b.MAT.13.36,Τότε ἀφεὶς τοὺς ὄχλους ἦλθεν εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν καὶ προσῆλθον αὐτῷ οἱ μαθηταὶ αὐτοῦ λέγοντες φράσον ἡμῖν τὴν παραβολὴν τῶν ζιζανίων τοῦ ἀγροῦ 
b.MAT.13.37,"He answered and said unto them , He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man ; ",b.MAT.13.37,ὁ δὲ ἀποκριθεὶς εἶπεν ὁ σπείρων τὸ καλὸν σπέρμα ἐστὶν ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου 
b.MAT.13.38,The field is the world ; the good seed are the children of the kingdom ; but the tares are the children of the wicked one ; ,b.MAT.13.38,ὁ δὲ ἀγρός ἐστιν ὁ κόσμος τὸ δὲ καλὸν σπέρμα οὗτοί εἰσιν οἱ υἱοὶ τῆς βασιλείας τὰ δὲ ζιζάνιά εἰσιν οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ πονηροῦ 
b.MAT.13.39,The enemy that sowed them is the devil ; the harvest is the end of the world ; and the reapers are the angels . ,b.MAT.13.39,ὁ δὲ ἐχθρὸς ὁ σπείρας αὐτά ἐστιν ὁ διάβολος ὁ δὲ θερισμὸς συντέλεια αἰῶνός ἐστιν οἱ δὲ θερισταὶ ἄγγελοί εἰσιν 
b.MAT.13.40,As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire ; so shall it be in the end of this world . ,b.MAT.13.40,ὥσπερ οὖν συλλέγεται τὰ ζιζάνια καὶ πυρὶ κατακαίεται οὕτως ἔσται ἐν τῇ συντελείᾳ τοῦ αἰῶνος 
b.MAT.13.41,"The Son of man shall send forth his angels , and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend , and them which do iniquity ; ",b.MAT.13.41,ἀποστελεῖ ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου τοὺς ἀγγέλους αὐτοῦ καὶ συλλέξουσιν ἐκ τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ πάντα τὰ σκάνδαλα καὶ τοὺς ποιοῦντας τὴν ἀνομίαν 
b.MAT.13.42,And shall cast them into a furnace of fire : there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth . ,b.MAT.13.42,καὶ βαλοῦσιν αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν κάμινον τοῦ πυρός ἐκεῖ ἔσται ὁ κλαυθμὸς καὶ ὁ βρυγμὸς τῶν ὀδόντων 
b.MAT.13.43,"Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father . Who hath ears to hear , let him hear . ",b.MAT.13.43,τότε οἱ δίκαιοι ἐκλάμψουσιν ὡς ὁ ἥλιος ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῶν ὁ ἔχων ὦτα ἀκουέτω 
b.MAT.13.44,"Again , the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field ; the which when a man hath found , he hideth , and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath , and buyeth that field . ",b.MAT.13.44,Ὁμοία ἐστὶν ἡ βασιλεία τῶν οὐρανῶν θησαυρῷ κεκρυμμένῳ ἐν τῷ ἀγρῷ ὃν εὑρὼν ἄνθρωπος ἔκρυψεν καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς χαρᾶς αὐτοῦ ὑπάγει καὶ πωλεῖ πάντα ὅσα ἔχει καὶ ἀγοράζει τὸν ἀγρὸν ἐκεῖνον 
b.MAT.13.45,"Again , the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man , seeking goodly pearls : ",b.MAT.13.45,Πάλιν ὁμοία ἐστὶν ἡ βασιλεία τῶν οὐρανῶν ἀνθρώπῳ ἐμπόρῳ ζητοῦντι καλοὺς μαργαρίτας

b.MAT.13.47,"Again , the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net , that was cast into the sea , and gathered of every kind : ",b.MAT.13.47,Πάλιν ὁμοία ἐστὶν ἡ βασιλεία τῶν οὐρανῶν σαγήνῃ βληθείσῃ εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν καὶ ἐκ παντὸς γένους συναγαγούσῃ 
b.MAT.13.48,"Which , when it was full , they drew to shore , and sat down , and gathered the good into vessels , but cast the bad away . ",b.MAT.13.48,ἣν ὅτε ἐπληρώθη ἀναβιβάσαντες ἐπὶ τὸν αἰγιαλὸν καὶ καθίσαντες συνέλεξαν τὰ καλὰ εἰς ἄγγη τὰ δὲ σαπρὰ ἔξω ἔβαλον 
b.MAT.13.49,"So shall it be at the end of the world : the angels shall come forth , and sever the wicked from among the just , ",b.MAT.13.49,οὕτως ἔσται ἐν τῇ συντελείᾳ τοῦ αἰῶνος ἐξελεύσονται οἱ ἄγγελοι καὶ ἀφοριοῦσιν τοὺς πονηροὺς ἐκ μέσου τῶν δικαίων

b.MAT.13.54,"And when he was come into his own country , he taught them in their synagogue , insomuch that they were astonished , and said , Whence hath this man this wisdom , and these mighty works ?

b.LUK.9.40,And I besought thy disciples to cast him out ; and they could not . ,b.LUK.9.40,καὶ ἐδεήθην τῶν μαθητῶν σου ἵνα ἐκβάλωσιν αὐτό καὶ οὐκ ἠδυνήθησαν 
b.LUK.9.41,"And Jesus answering said , O faithless and perverse generation , how long shall I be with you , and suffer you ? Bring thy son hither . ",b.LUK.9.41,ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν ὦ γενεὰ ἄπιστος καὶ διεστραμμένη ἕως πότε ἔσομαι πρὸς ὑμᾶς καὶ ἀνέξομαι ὑμῶν προσάγαγε ὧδε τὸν υἱόν σου 
b.LUK.9.42,"And as he was yet a coming , the devil threw him down , and tare him . And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , and healed the child , and delivered him again to his father .

b.JOH.4.37,"And herein is that saying true , One soweth , and another reapeth . ",b.JOH.4.37,ἐν γὰρ τούτῳ ὁ λόγος ἐστὶν ἀληθινός ὅτι ἄλλος ἐστὶν ὁ σπείρων καὶ ἄλλος ὁ θερίζων 
b.JOH.4.38,"I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour : other men laboured , and ye are entered into their labours . ",b.JOH.4.38,ἐγὼ ἀπέσταλκα ὑμᾶς θερίζειν ὃ οὐχ ὑμεῖς κεκοπιάκατε ἄλλοι κεκοπιάκασιν καὶ ὑμεῖς εἰς τὸν κόπον αὐτῶν εἰσεληλύθατε 
b.JOH.4.39,"And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman , which testified , He told me all that ever I did . ",b.JOH.4.39,Ἐκ δὲ τῆς πόλεως ἐκείνης πολλοὶ ἐπίστευσαν εἰς αὐτὸν τῶν Σαμαριτῶν διὰ τὸν λόγον τῆς γυναικὸς μαρτυρούσης ὅτι εἶπέν μοι πάντα ἃ ἐποίησα 
b.JOH.4.40,"So when the Samaritans were come unto him , they besought him that he would tarry with them : and he abode there two days . ",b.JOH.4.40,ὡς οὖν ἦλθον πρὸς αὐτὸν οἱ Σαμαρῖται ἠρώτων αὐτὸν μεῖναι παρ ’ αὐτοῖς καὶ ἔμεινεν ἐκεῖ δύο ἡμέρας 
b.JOH.4.41,And many more believed because of his own word ; ,b.JOH.4.41,καὶ πολλῷ πλείους ἐπίστευσαν διὰ τὸν λόγον αὐτοῦ 
b.JOH.4.42,"And said unto the woman , Now we believe , not because of thy saying : for we have heard him ourselves , and know that this is indeed the Christ , the Saviour of the world . ",b.JOH.4.42,τῇ τε γυναικὶ ἔλεγον ὅτι οὐκέτι διὰ τὴν σὴν λαλιὰν πιστεύομεν αὐτοὶ γὰρ ἀκηκόαμεν καὶ οἴδαμεν ὅτι οὗτός ἐστιν ἀληθῶς ὁ σωτὴρ τοῦ κόσμου 
b.JOH.4.43,"Now after two days he departed thence , and went into Galilee . ",b.JOH.4.43,Μετὰ δὲ τὰς δύο ἡμέρας ἐξῆλθεν ἐκεῖθεν εἰς τὴν Γαλιλαίαν 
b.JOH.4.44,"For Jesus himself testified , that a prophet hath no honour in his own country . ",b.JOH.4.44,αὐτὸς γὰρ Ἰησοῦς ἐμαρτύρησεν ὅτι προφήτης ἐν τῇ ἰδίᾳ πατρίδι τιμὴν οὐκ ἔχει 
b.JOH.4.45,"Then when he was come into Galilee , the Galilaeans received him , having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast : for they also went unto the feast . ",b.JOH.4.45,ὡς οὖν ἦλθεν εἰς τὴν Γαλιλαίαν ἐδέξαντο αὐτὸν οἱ Γαλιλαῖοι πάντα ἑωρακότες ἅ ἐποίησεν ἐν Ἱεροσολύμοις ἐν τῇ ἑορτῇ καὶ αὐτοὶ γὰρ ἦλθον εἰς τὴν ἑορτήν 
b.JOH.4.46,"So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee , where he made the water wine . And there was a certain nobleman , whose son was sick at Capernaum . ",b.JOH.4.46,ἦλθεν οὖν πάλιν εἰς τὴν Κανὰ τῆς Γαλιλαίας ὅπου ἐποίησεν τὸ ὕδωρ οἶνον Ἦν δέ βασιλικός οὗ ὁ υἱὸς ἠσθένει ἐν Καφαρναούμ 
b.JOH.4.47,"When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee , he went unto him , and besought him that he would come down , and heal his son : for he was at the point of death . ",b.JOH.4.47,οὗτος ἀκούσας ὅτι Ἰησοῦς ἥκει ἐκ τῆς Ἰουδαίας εἰς τὴν Γαλιλαίαν ἀπῆλθεν πρὸς αὐτόν καὶ ἠρώτα ἵνα καταβῇ καὶ ἰάσηται αὐτοῦ τὸν υἱόν ἤμελλεν γὰρ ἀποθνῄσκειν 
b.JOH.4.48,"Then said Jesus unto him , Except ye see signs and wonders , ye will not believe . ",b.JOH.4.48,εἶπεν οὖν ὁ Ἰησοῦς πρὸς αὐτόν ἐὰν μὴ σημεῖα καὶ τέρατα ἴδητε οὐ μὴ πιστεύσητε 
b.JOH.4.49,"The nobleman saith unto him , Sir , come down ere my child die . ",b.JOH.4.49,λέγει πρὸς αὐτὸν ὁ βασιλικός κύριε κατάβηθι πρὶν ἀποθανεῖν τὸ παιδίον μου 
b.JOH.4.50,"Jesus saith unto him , Go thy way ; thy son liveth . And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him , and he went his way . ",b.JOH.4.50,λέγει αὐτῷ ὁ Ἰησοῦς πορεύου ὁ υἱός σου ζῇ ἐπίστευσεν ὁ ἄνθρωπος τῷ λόγῳ ὃν εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὁ Ἰησοῦς καὶ ἐπορεύετο 
b.JOH.4.51,"And as he was now going down , his servants met him , and told him , saying , Thy son liveth . ",b.JOH.4.51,ἤδη δὲ αὐτοῦ καταβαίνοντος οἱ δοῦλοι ὑπήντησαν αὐτῷ καὶ ἤγγειλαν ὅτι ὁ παῖς αὐτοῦ ζῇ 
b.JOH.4.52,"Then inquired he of them the hour when he began to amend . And they said unto him , Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him . ",b.JOH.4.52,ἐπύθετο οὖν τὴν ὥραν παρ ’ αὐτῶν ἐν ᾗ κομψότερον ἔσχεν εἶπον οὖν αὐτῷ ὅτι ἐχθὲς ὥραν ἑβδόμην ἀφῆκεν αὐτὸν ὁ πυρετός 
b.JOH.4.53,"So the father knew that it was at the same hour , in the which Jesus said unto him , Thy son liveth : and himself believed , and his whole house . ",b.JOH.4.53,ἔγνω οὖν ὁ πατὴρ ὅτι ἐκείνῃ τῇ ὥρᾳ ἐν ᾗ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὁ Ἰησοῦς ὁ υἱός σου ζῇ καὶ ἐπίστευσεν αὐτὸς καὶ ἡ οἰκία αὐτοῦ ὅλη 
b.JOH.4.54,"This is again the second miracle that Jesus did , when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee . ",b.JOH.4.54,Τοῦτο πάλιν δεύτερον σημεῖον ἐποίησεν ὁ Ἰησοῦς ἐλθὼν ἐκ τῆς Ἰουδαίας εἰς τὴν Γαλιλαίαν 
b.JOH.5.1,After this there was a feast of the Jews ; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem . ,b.JOH.5.1,Μετὰ ταῦτα ἦν ἡ ἑορτὴ τῶν Ἰουδαίων καὶ ἀνέβη Ἰησοῦς εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα 
b.JOH.5.2,"Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool , which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda , having five porches . ",b.JOH.5.2,ἔστιν δὲ ἐν τοῖς Ἱεροσολύμοις ἐπὶ τῇ προβατικῇ κολυμβήθρα τὸ λεγόμενον Ἑβραϊστὶ Βηθζαθά πέντε στοὰς ἔχουσα 
b.JOH.5.3,"In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk , of blind , halt , withered , waiting for the moving of the water . ",b.JOH.5.3,ἐν ταύταις κατέκειτο πλῆθος τῶν ἀσθενούντων τυφλῶν χωλῶν ξηρῶν 
b.JOH.5.5,"And a certain man was there , which had an infirmity thirty and eight years . ",b.JOH.5.5,ἦν δέ τις ἄνθρωπος ἐκεῖ τριάκοντα καὶ ὀκτὼ ἔτη ἔχων ἐν τῇ ἀσθενείᾳ αὐτοῦ 
b.JOH.5.6,"When Jesus saw him lie , and knew that he had been now a long time in that case , he saith unto him , Wilt thou be made whole ? ",b.JOH.5.6,τοῦτον ἰδὼν ὁ Ἰησοῦς κατακείμενον καὶ γνοὺς ὅτι πολὺν ἤδη χρόνον ἔχει λέγει αὐτῷ θέλεις ὑγιὴς γενέσθαι 
b.JOH.5.7,"The impotent man answered him , Sir , I have no man , when the water is troubled , to put me into the pool : but while I am coming , another steppeth down before me . ",b.JOH.5.7,ἀπεκρίθη αὐτῷ ὁ ἀσθενῶν κύριε ἄνθρωπον οὐκ ἔχω ἵνα ὅταν ταραχθῇ τὸ ὕδωρ βάλῃ με εἰς τὴν κολυμβήθραν ἐν ᾧ δὲ ἔρχομαι ἐγὼ ἄλλος πρὸ ἐμοῦ καταβαίνει 
b.JOH.5.8,"Jesus saith unto him , Rise , take up thy bed , and walk . ",b.JOH.5.8,λέγει αὐτῷ ὁ Ἰησοῦς ἔγειρε ἆρον τὸν κράβαττόν σου καὶ περιπάτει 
b.JOH.5.9,"And immediately the man was made whole , and took up his bed , and walked : and on the same day was the sabbath . ",b.JOH.5.9,καὶ ἐγένετο ὑγιὴς ὁ ἄνθρωπος καὶ ἦρεν τὸν κράβαττον αὐτοῦ καὶ περιεπάτει ἦν δὲ σάββατον ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ 
b.JOH.5.10,"The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured , It is the sabbath day : it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed . ",b.JOH.5.10,ἔλεγον οὖν οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι τῷ τεθεραπευμένῳ σάββατόν ἐστιν καὶ οὐκ ἔξεστίν σοι ἆραι τὸν κράβαττόν 
b.JOH.5.11,"He answered them , He that made me whole , the same said unto me , Take up thy bed , and walk . ",b.JOH.5.11,ἀπεκρίθη αὐτοῖς ὁ ποιήσας με ὑγιῆ ἐκεῖνός μοι εἶπεν ἆρον τὸν κράβαττόν σου καὶ περιπάτει 
b.JOH.5.12,"Then asked they him , What man is that which said unto thee , Take up thy bed , and walk ? ",b.JOH.5.12,ἠρώτησαν αὐτόν τίς ἐστιν ὁ ἄνθρωπος ὁ εἰπών σοι ἆρον καὶ περιπάτει 
b.JOH.5.13,"And he that was healed wist not who it was : for Jesus had conveyed himself away , a multitude being in that place . ",b.JOH.5.13,ὁ δὲ ἀσθενῶν οὐκ ᾔδει τίς ἐστιν ὁ γὰρ Ἰησοῦς ἐξένευσεν ὄχλου ὄντος ἐν τῷ τόπῳ 
b.JOH.5.14,"Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple , and said unto him , Behold , thou art made whole : sin no more , lest a worse thing come unto thee . ",b.JOH.5.14,μετὰ ταῦτα εὑρίσκει αὐτὸν ὁ Ἰησοῦς ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ἴδε ὑγιὴς γέγονας μηκέτι ἁμάρτανε ἵνα μὴ χεῖρόν σοί τι γένηται 
b.JOH.5.15,"The man departed , and told the Jews that it was Jesus , which had made him whole . ",b.JOH.5.15,ἀπῆλθεν ὁ ἄνθρωπος καὶ εἶπεν τοῖς Ἰουδαίοις ὅτι Ἰησοῦς ἐστιν ὁ ποιήσας αὐτὸν ὑγιῆ 
b.JOH.5.16,"And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus , and sought to slay him , because he had done these things on the sabbath day . ",b.JOH.5.16,καὶ διὰ τοῦτο ἐδίωκον οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι τὸν Ἰησοῦν ὅτι ταῦτα ἐποίει ἐν σαββάτῳ 
b.JOH.5.17,"But Jesus answered them , My Father worketh hitherto , and I work . ",b.JOH.5.17,ὁ δὲ ἀπεκρίνατο αὐτοῖς ὁ πατήρ μου ἕως ἄρτι ἐργάζεται καὶ ἐγώ ἐργάζομαι 
b.JOH.5.18,"Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him , because he not only had broken the sabbath , but said also that God was his Father , making himself equal with God . ",b.JOH.5.18,διὰ τοῦτο μᾶλλον ἐζήτουν αὐτὸν οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι ἀποκτεῖναι ὅτι οὐ μόνον ἔλυεν τὸ σάββατον ἀλλὰ καὶ πατέρα ἴδιον ἔλεγεν τὸν θεόν ἴσον ἑαυτὸν ποιῶν τῷ θεῷ 
b.JOH.5.19,"Then answered Jesus and said unto them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , The Son can do nothing of himself , but what he seeth the Father do : for what things soever he doeth , these also doeth the Son likewise . ",b.JOH.5.19,Ἀπεκρίνατο οὖν ὁ Ἰησοῦς καὶ ἔλεγεν αὐτοῖς ἀμὴν ἀμὴν λέγω ὑμῖν οὐ δύναται ὁ υἱὸς ποιεῖν ἀφ ’ ἑαυτοῦ οὐδέν ἂν μή τι βλέπῃ τὸν πατέρα ποιοῦντα ἃ γὰρ ἂν ἐκεῖνος ποιῇ ταῦτα καὶ ὁ υἱὸς ποιεῖ ὁμοίως 
b.JOH.5.20,"For the Father loveth the Son , and sheweth him all things that himself doeth : and he will shew him greater works than these , that ye may marvel . ",b.JOH.5.20,ὁ γὰρ πατὴρ φιλεῖ τὸν υἱὸν καὶ πάντα δείκνυσιν αὐτῷ ἃ αὐτὸς ποιεῖ καὶ μείζονα τούτων δείξει αὐτῷ ἔργα ἵνα ὑμεῖς θαυμάζετε 
b.JOH.5.21,"For as the Father raiseth up the dead , and quickeneth them ; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will . ",b.JOH.5.21,ὥσπερ γὰρ ὁ πατὴρ ἐγείρει τοὺς νεκροὺς καὶ ζῳοποιεῖ οὕτως καὶ ὁ υἱὸς οὓς θέλει ζῳοποιεῖ 
b.JOH.5.22,"For the Father judgeth no man , but hath committed all judgment unto the Son : ",b.JOH.5.22,οὐδὲ γὰρ ὁ πατὴρ κρίνει οὐδένα ἀλλὰ τὴν κρίσιν πᾶσαν δέδωκεν τῷ υἱῷ 
b.JOH.5.23,"That all men should honour the Son , even as they honour the Father . He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him . ",b.JOH.5.23,ἵνα πάντες τιμῶσι τὸν υἱὸν καθὼς τιμῶσι τὸν πατέρα ὁ μὴ τιμῶν τὸν υἱὸν οὐ τιμᾷ τὸν πατέρα τὸν πέμψαντα αὐτόν 
b.JOH.5.24,"Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that heareth my word , and believeth on him that sent me , hath everlasting life , and shall not come into condemnation ; but is passed from death unto life . ",b.JOH.5.24,ἀμὴν ἀμὴν λέγω ὑμῖν ὅτι ὁ τὸν λόγον μου ἀκούων καὶ πιστεύων τῷ πέμψαντί με ἔχει ζωὴν αἰώνιον καὶ εἰς κρίσιν οὐκ ἔρχεται ἀλλὰ μεταβέβηκεν ἐκ τοῦ θανάτου εἰς τὴν ζωήν 
b.JOH.5.25,"Verily , verily , I say unto you , The hour is coming , and now is , when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God : and they that hear shall live . ",b.JOH.5.25,ἀμὴν ἀμὴν λέγω ὑμῖν ὅτι ἔρχεται ὥρα καὶ νῦν ἐστιν ὅτε οἱ νεκροὶ ἀκούσουσιν τῆς φωνῆς τοῦ υἱοῦ τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ οἱ ἀκούσαντες ζήσουσιν 
b.JOH.5.26,For as the Father hath life in himself ; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself ; ,b.JOH.5.26,ὥσπερ γὰρ ὁ πατὴρ ἔχει ζωὴν ἐν ἑαυτῷ οὕτως καὶ τῷ υἱῷ ἔδωκεν ζωὴν ἔχειν ἐν ἑαυτῷ 
b.JOH.5.27,"And hath given him authority to execute judgment also , because he is the Son of man . ",b.JOH.5.27,καὶ ἐξουσίαν ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ κρίσιν ποιεῖν ὅτι υἱὸς ἀνθρώπου ἐστίν 
b.JOH.5.28,"Marvel not at this : for the hour is coming , in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice , ",b.JOH.5.28,μὴ θαυμάζετε τοῦτο ὅτι ἔρχεται ὥρα ἐν ᾗ πάντες οἱ ἐν τοῖς μνημείοις ἀκούσουσιν τῆς φωνῆς αὐτοῦ 
b.JOH.5.29,"And shall come forth ; they that have done good , unto the resurrection of life ; and they that have done evil , unto the resurrection of damnation . ",b.JOH.5.29,καὶ ἐκπορεύσονται οἱ τὰ ἀγαθὰ ποιήσαντες εἰς ἀνάστασιν ζωῆς οἱ τὰ φαῦλα πράξαντες εἰς ἀνάστασιν κρίσεως 
b.JOH.5.30,"I can of mine own self do nothing : as I hear , I judge : and my judgment is just ; because I seek not mine own will , but the will of the Father which hath sent me . ",b.JOH.5.30,οὐ δύναμαι ἐγὼ ποιεῖν ἀπ ’ ἐμαυτοῦ οὐδέν καθὼς ἀκούω κρίνω καὶ ἡ κρίσις ἡ ἐμὴ δικαία ἐστίν ὅτι οὐ ζητῶ τὸ θέλημα τὸ ἐμὸν ἀλλὰ τὸ θέλημα τοῦ πέμψαντός με 
b.JOH.5.31,"If I bear witness of myself , my witness is not true . ",b.JOH.5.31,ἐὰν ἐγὼ μαρτυρῶ περὶ ἐμαυτοῦ ἡ μαρτυρία μου οὐκ ἔστιν ἀληθής 
b.JOH.5.32,There is another that beareth witness of me ; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true . ,b.JOH.5.32,ἄλλος ἐστὶν ὁ μαρτυρῶν περὶ ἐμοῦ καὶ οἴδατε ὅτι ἀληθής ἐστιν ἡ μαρτυρία ἣν μαρτυρεῖ περὶ ἐμοῦ 
b.JOH.5.33,"Ye sent unto John , and he bare witness unto the truth . ",b.JOH.5.33,ὑμεῖς ἀπεστάλκατε πρὸς Ἰωάννην καὶ μεμαρτύρηκεν τῇ ἀληθείᾳ 
b.JOH.5.34,"But I receive not testimony from man : but these things I say , that ye might be saved . ",b.JOH.5.34,ἐγὼ δὲ οὐ παρὰ ἀνθρώπου τὴν μαρτυρίαν λαμβάνω ἀλλὰ ταῦτα λέγω ἵνα ὑμεῖς σωθῆτε 
b.JOH.5.35,He was a burning and a shining light : and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light . ,b.JOH.5.35,ἐκεῖνος ἦν ὁ λύχνος ὁ καιόμενος καὶ φαίνων ὑμεῖς δὲ ἠθελήσατε ἀγαλλιαθῆναι πρὸς ὥραν ἐν τῷ φωτὶ αὐτοῦ 
b.JOH.5.36,"But I have greater witness than that of John : for the works which the Father hath given me to finish , the same works that I do , bear witness of me , that the Father hath sent me . ",b.JOH.5.36,ἐγὼ δὲ ἔχω τὴν μαρτυρίαν μείζω τοῦ Ἰωάννου τὰ γὰρ ἔργα ἃ δέδωκέν μοι ὁ πατὴρ ἵνα τελειώσω αὐτά αὐτὰ τὰ ἔργα ἃ ποιῶ μαρτυρεῖ περὶ ἐμοῦ ὅτι ὁ πατήρ με ἀπέσταλκεν 
b.JOH.5.37,"And the Father himself , which hath sent me , hath borne witness of me . Ye have neither heard his voice at any time , nor seen his shape . ",b.JOH.5.37,καὶ ὁ πέμψας με πατήρ ἐκεῖνος μεμαρτύρηκεν περὶ ἐμοῦ οὔτε φωνὴν αὐτοῦ πώποτε ἀκηκόατε οὔτε εἶδος αὐτοῦ ἑωράκατε 
b.JOH.5.38,"And ye have not his word abiding in you : for whom he hath sent , him ye believe not . ",b.JOH.5.38,καὶ τὸν λόγον αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἔχετε ἐν ὑμῖν μένοντα ὅτι ὃν ἀπέστειλεν ἐκεῖνος τούτῳ ὑμεῖς οὐ πιστεύετε 
b.JOH.5.39,Search the scriptures ; for in them ye think ye have eternal life : and they are they which testify of me . ,b.JOH.5.39,ἐραυνᾶτε τὰς γραφάς ὅτι ὑμεῖς δοκεῖτε ἐν αὐταῖς ζωὴν αἰώνιον ἔχειν καὶ ἐκεῖναί εἰσίν αἱ μαρτυροῦσαι περὶ ἐμοῦ 
b.JOH.5.40,"And ye will not come to me , that ye might have life . ",b.JOH.5.40,καὶ οὐ θέλετε ἐλθεῖν πρός με ἵνα ζωὴν ἔχητε 
b.JOH.5.41,I receive not honour from men . ,b.JOH.5.41,δόξαν παρὰ ἀνθρώπων οὐ λαμβάνω 
b.JOH.5.42,"But I know you , that ye have not the love of God in you . ",b.JOH.5.42,ἀλλὰ ἔγνωκα ὑμᾶς ὅτι οὐκ ἔχετε τὴν ἀγάπην τοῦ θεοῦ ἐν ἑαυτοῖς 
b.JOH.5.43,"I am come in my Father ' s name , and ye receive me not : if another shall come in his own name , him ye will receive . ",b.JOH.5.43,ἐγὼ ἐλήλυθα ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι τοῦ πατρός μου καὶ οὐ λαμβάνετέ με ἐὰν ἄλλος ἔλθῃ ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι τῷ ἰδίῳ ἐκεῖνον λήμψεσθε 
b.JOH.5.44,"How can ye believe , which receive honour one of another , and seek not the honour that cometh from God only ? ",b.JOH.5.44,πῶς δύνασθε ὑμεῖς πιστεῦσαι δόξαν παρὰ ἀλλήλων λαμβάνοντες καὶ τὴν δόξαν τὴν παρὰ τοῦ μόνου θεοῦ οὐ ζητεῖτε 
b.JOH.5.45,"Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father : there is one that accuseth you , even Moses , in whom ye trust . ",b.JOH.5.45,μὴ δοκεῖτε ὅτι ἐγὼ κατηγορήσω ὑμῶν πρὸς τὸν πατέρα ἔστιν ὁ κατηγορῶν ὑμῶν Μωϋσῆς εἰς ὃν ὑμεῖς ἠλπίκατε 
b.JOH.5.46,"For had ye believed Moses , ye would have believed me : for he wrote of me . ",b.JOH.5.46,εἰ γὰρ ἐπιστεύετε Μωϋσεῖ ἐπιστεύετε ἂν ἐμοί περὶ γὰρ ἐμοῦ ἐκεῖνος ἔγραψεν 
b.JOH.5.47,"But if ye believe not his writings , how shall ye believe my words ? ",b.JOH.5.47,εἰ δὲ τοῖς ἐκείνου γράμμασιν οὐ πιστεύετε πῶς τοῖς ἐμοῖς ῥήμασιν πιστεύσετε 
b.JOH.6.1,"After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee , which is the sea of Tiberias . ",b.JOH.6.1,Μετὰ ταῦτα ἀπῆλθεν ὁ Ἰησοῦς πέραν τῆς θαλάσσης τῆς Γαλιλαίας τῆς Τιβεριάδος 
b.JOH.6.2,"And a great multitude followed him , because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased . ",b.JOH.6.2,ἠκολούθει δὲ αὐτῷ ὄχλος πολύς ὅτι ἑώρων τὰ σημεῖα ἃ ἐποίει ἐπὶ τῶν ἀσθενούντων 
b.JOH.6.3,"And Jesus went up into a mountain , and there he sat with his disciples . ",b.JOH.6.3,ἀνῆλθεν δὲ εἰς τὸ ὄρος Ἰησοῦς καὶ ἐκεῖ ἐκαθέζετο μετὰ τῶν μαθητῶν αὐτοῦ 
b.JOH.6.4,"And the passover , a feast of the Jews , was nigh . ",b.JOH.6.4,ἦν δὲ ἐγγὺς τὸ πάσχα ἡ ἑορτὴ τῶν Ἰουδαίων 
b.JOH.6.5,"When Jesus then lifted up his eyes , and saw a great company come unto him , he saith unto Philip , Whence shall we buy bread , that these may eat ? ",b.JOH.6.5,ἐπάρας οὖν τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς ὁ Ἰησοῦς καὶ θεασάμενος ὅτι πολὺς ὄχλος ἔρχεται πρὸς αὐτὸν λέγει πρὸς Φίλιππον πόθεν ἀγοράσωμεν ἄρτους ἵνα φάγωσιν οὗτοι 
b.JOH.6.6,And this he said to prove him : for he himself knew what he would do . ,b.JOH.6.6,τοῦτο δὲ ἔλεγεν πειράζων αὐτόν αὐτὸς γὰρ ᾔδει τί ἔμελλεν ποιεῖν 
b.JOH.6.7,"Philip answered him , Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them , that every one of them may take a little . ",b.JOH.6.7,ἀποκρίνεται αὐτῷ ὁ Φίλιππος διακοσίων δηναρίων ἄρτοι οὐκ ἀρκοῦσιν αὐτοῖς ἵνα ἕκαστος βραχύ τι λάβῃ 
b.JOH.6.8,"One of his disciples , Andrew , Simon Peter ' s brother , saith unto him , ",b.JOH.6.8,λέγει αὐτῷ εἷς ἐκ τῶν μαθητῶν αὐτοῦ Ἀνδρέας ὁ ἀδελφὸς Σίμωνος Πέτρου 
b.JOH.6.9,"There is a lad here , which hath five barley loaves , and two small fishes : but what are they among so many ? ",b.JOH.6.9,ἔστιν παιδάριον ὧδε ὃς ἔχει πέντε ἄρτους κριθίνους καὶ δύο ὀψάρια ἀλλὰ ταῦτα τί ἐστιν εἰς τοσούτους 
b.JOH.6.10,"And Jesus said , Make the men sit down . Now there was much grass in the place . So the men sat down , in number about five thousand . ",b.JOH.6.10,εἶπεν ὁ Ἰησοῦς ποιήσατε τοὺς ἀνθρώπους ἀναπεσεῖν ἦν δὲ χόρτος πολὺς ἐν τῷ τόπῳ ἀνέπεσαν οὖν οἱ ἄνδρες τὸν ἀριθμὸν ὡς πεντακισχίλιοι 
b.JOH.6.11,"And Jesus took the loaves ; and when he had given thanks , he distributed to the disciples , and the disciples to them that were set down ; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would . ",b.JOH.6.11,ἔλαβεν οὖν τοὺς ἄρτους ὁ Ἰησοῦς καὶ εὐχαρίστησεν καὶ ἔδωκεν τοῖς ἀνακειμένοις ὁμοίως καὶ ἐκ τῶν ὀψαρίων ὅσον ἤθελον 
b.JOH.6.12,"When they were filled , he said unto his disciples , Gather up the fragments that remain , that nothing be lost . ",b.JOH.6.12,ὡς δὲ ἐνεπλήσθησαν λέγει τοῖς μαθηταῖς αὐτοῦ συναγάγετε τὰ περισσεύσαντα κλάσματα ἵνα μή τι ἀπόληται 
b.JOH.6.13,"Therefore they gathered them together , and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves , which remained over and above unto them that had eaten .

b.JOH.6.14,"Then those men , when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did , said , This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world . ",b.JOH.6.14,Οἱ οὖν ἄνθρωποι ἰδόντες ὃ ἐποίησεν σημεῖον ἔλεγον ὅτι οὗτός ἐστιν ἀληθῶς ὁ προφήτης ὁ εἰς τὸν κόσμον ἐρχόμενος 
b.JOH.6.15,"When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force , to make him a king , he departed again into a mountain himself alone . ",b.JOH.6.15,Ἰησοῦς οὖν γνοὺς ὅτι μέλλουσιν ἔρχεσθαι καὶ ἁρπάζειν αὐτὸν ἵνα ποιήσωσιν βασιλέα φεύγει πάλιν εἰς τὸ ὄρος αὐτὸς μόνος 
b.JOH.6.16,"And when even was now come , his disciples went down unto the sea , ",b.JOH.6.16,Ὡς δὲ ὀψία ἐγένετο κατέβησαν οἱ μαθηταὶ αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὴν θάλασσαν 
b.JOH.6.17,"And entered into a ship , and went over the sea toward Capernaum . And it was now dark , and Jesus was not come to them . ",b.JOH.6.17,καὶ ἐμβάντες εἰς πλοῖον ἤρχοντο πέραν τῆς θαλάσσης εἰς Καφαρναούμ κατέλαβεν δὲ αὐτοὺς ἡ σκοτία καὶ οὔπω ἐληλύθει Ἰησοῦς πρὸς αὐτοὺς 
b.JOH.6.18,And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew . ,b.JOH.6.18,ἥ τε θάλασσα ἀνέμου μεγάλου πνέοντος διεγείρετο 
b.JOH.6.19,"So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs , they see Jesus walking on the sea , and drawing nigh unto the ship : and they were afraid .

b.JOH.11.2," ( It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment , and wiped his feet with her hair , whose brother Lazarus was sick . ) ",b.JOH.11.2,ἦν δὲ Μαρία ἡ ἀλείψασα τὸν κύριον μύρῳ καὶ ἐκμάξασα τοὺς πόδας αὐτοῦ ταῖς θριξὶν αὐτῆς ἧς ὁ ἀδελφὸς Λάζαρος ἠσθένει 
b.JOH.11.3,"Therefore his sisters sent unto him , saying , Lord , behold , he whom thou lovest is sick . ",b.JOH.11.3,ἀπέστειλαν οὖν αἱ ἀδελφαὶ πρὸς αὐτὸν λέγουσαι κύριε ἴδε ὃν φιλεῖς ἀσθενεῖ 
b.JOH.11.4,"When Jesus heard that , he said , This sickness is not unto death , but for the glory of God , that the Son of God might be glorified thereby . ",b.JOH.11.4,ἀκούσας δὲ ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν αὕτη ἡ ἀσθένεια οὐκ ἔστιν πρὸς θάνατον ἀλλ ’ ὑπὲρ τῆς δόξης τοῦ θεοῦ ἵνα δοξασθῇ ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ θεοῦ δι ’ αὐτῆς 
b.JOH.11.5,"Now Jesus loved Martha , and her sister , and Lazarus . ",b.JOH.11.5,ἠγάπα δὲ ὁ Ἰησοῦς τὴν Μάρθαν καὶ τὴν ἀδελφὴν αὐτῆς καὶ τὸν Λάζαρον 
b.JOH.11.6,"When he had heard therefore that he was sick , he abode two days still in the same place where he was . ",b.JOH.11.6,ὡς οὖν ἤκουσεν ὅτι ἀσθενεῖ τότε μὲν ἔμεινεν ἐν ᾧ ἦν τόπῳ δύο ἡμέρας

b.JOH.11.9,"Jesus answered , Are there not twelve hours in the day ? If any man walk in the day , he stumbleth not , because he seeth the light of this world . ",b.JOH.11.9,ἀπεκρίθη Ἰησοῦς οὐχὶ δώδεκα ὧραί εἰσίν τῆς ἡμέρας ἐάν τις περιπατῇ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ οὐ προσκόπτει ὅτι τὸ φῶς τοῦ κόσμου τούτου βλέπει 
b.JOH.11.10,"But if a man walk in the night , he stumbleth , because there is no light in him . ",b.JOH.11.10,ἐὰν δέ τις περιπατῇ ἐν τῇ νυκτί προσκόπτει ὅτι τὸ φῶς οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν αὐτῷ 
b.JOH.11.11,"These things said he : and after that he saith unto them , Our friend Lazarus sleepeth ; but I go , that I may awake him out of sleep . ",b.JOH.11.11,ταῦτα εἶπεν καὶ μετὰ τοῦτο λέγει αὐτοῖς Λάζαρος ὁ φίλος ἡμῶν κεκοίμηται ἀλλὰ πορεύομαι ἵνα ἐξυπνίσω αὐτόν 
b.JOH.11.12,"Then said his disciples , Lord , if he sleep , he shall do well . ",b.JOH.11.12,εἶπον οὖν αὐτῷ οἱ μαθηταὶ κύριε εἰ κεκοίμηται σωθήσεται 
b.JOH.11.13,Howbeit Jesus spake of his death : but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep . ,b.JOH.11.13,εἰρήκει δὲ ὁ Ἰησοῦς περὶ τοῦ θανάτου αὐτοῦ ἐκεῖνοι δὲ ἔδοξαν ὅτι περὶ τῆς κοιμήσεως τοῦ ὕπνου λέγει 
b.JOH.11.14,"Then said Jesus unto them plainly , Lazarus is dead . ",b.JOH.11.14,τότε οὖν εἶπεν αὐτοῖς ὁ Ἰησοῦς παρρησίᾳ Λάζαρος ἀπέθανεν

b.JOH.11.53,Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death . ,b.JOH.11.53,ἀπ ’ ἐκείνης οὖν τῆς ἡμέρας ἐβουλεύσαντο ἵνα ἀποκτείνωσιν αὐτόν 
b.JOH.11.54,"Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews ; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness , into a city called Ephraim , and there continued with his disciples . ",b.JOH.11.54,Ἰησοῦς οὖν οὐκέτι παρρησίᾳ περιεπάτει ἐν τοῖς Ἰουδαίοις ἀλλὰ ἀπῆλθεν ἐκεῖθεν εἰς τὴν χώραν ἐγγὺς τῆς ἐρήμου εἰς Ἐφραὶμ λεγομένην πόλιν καὶ ἐκεῖ διέτριβεν μετὰ τῶν μαθητῶν 
b.JOH.11.55,"And the Jews ' passover was nigh at hand : and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover , to purify themselves . ",b.JOH.11.55,ἦν δὲ ἐγγὺς τὸ πάσχα τῶν Ἰουδαίων καὶ ἀνέβησαν πολλοὶ εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα ἐκ τῆς χώρας πρὸ τοῦ πάσχα ἵνα ἁγνίσωσιν ἑαυτούς 
b.JOH.11.56,"Then sought they for Jesus , and spake among themselves , as they stood in the temple , What think ye , that he will not come to the feast ? ",b.JOH.11.56,ἐζήτουν οὖν τὸν Ἰησοῦν καὶ ἔλεγαν μετ ’ ἀλλήλων ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ ἑστηκότες τί δοκεῖ ὑμῖν ὅτι οὐ μὴ ἔλθῃ εἰς τὴν ἑορτήν 
b.JOH.11.57,"Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment , that , if any man knew where he were , he should shew it , that they might take him . ",b.JOH.11.57,δεδώκεισαν δὲ οἱ ἀρχιερεῖς καὶ οἱ Φαρισαῖοι ἐντολὰς ἵνα ἐάν τις γνῷ ποῦ ἔστιν μηνύσῃ ὅπως πιάσωσιν αὐτόν 
b.JOH.12.1,"Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany , where Lazarus was which had been dead , whom he raised from the dead . ",b.JOH.12.1,Ὁ οὖν Ἰησοῦς πρὸ ἓξ ἡμερῶν τοῦ πάσχα ἦλθεν εἰς Βηθανίαν ὅπου ἦν Λάζαρος ὃν ἤγειρεν ἐκ νεκρῶν Ἰησοῦς 
b.JOH.12.2,There they made him a supper ; and Martha served : but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him . ,b.JOH.12.2,ἐποίησαν οὖν αὐτῷ δεῖπνον ἐκεῖ καὶ ἡ Μάρθα διηκόνει ὁ δὲ Λάζαρος εἷς ἦν ἐκ τῶν ἀνακειμένων σὺν αὐτῷ

b.JOH.18.12,"Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus , and bound him , ",b.JOH.18.12,Ἡ οὖν σπεῖρα καὶ ὁ χιλίαρχος καὶ οἱ ὑπηρέται τῶν Ἰουδαίων συνέλαβον τὸν Ἰησοῦν καὶ ἔδησαν αὐτόν 
b.JOH.18.13,"And led him away to Annas first ; for he was father in law to Caiaphas , which was the high priest that same year . ",b.JOH.18.13,καὶ ἤγαγον πρὸς Ἅνναν πρῶτον ἦν γὰρ πενθερὸς τοῦ Καϊάφα ὃς ἦν ἀρχιερεὺς τοῦ ἐνιαυτοῦ ἐκείνου

b.JOH.18.16,"But Peter stood at the door without . Then went out that other disciple , which was known unto the high priest , and spake unto her that kept the door , and brought in Peter .

b.JOH.18.18,"And the servants and officers stood there , who had made a fire of coals ; for it was cold : and they warmed themselves : and Peter stood with them , and warmed himself .

b.JOH.18.19,"The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples , and of his doctrine . ",b.JOH.18.19,Ὁ οὖν ἀρχιερεὺς ἠρώτησεν τὸν Ἰησοῦν περὶ τῶν μαθητῶν αὐτοῦ καὶ περὶ τῆς διδαχῆς αὐτοῦ 
b.JOH.18.20,"Jesus answered him , I spake openly to the world ; I ever taught in the synagogue , and in the temple , whither the Jews always resort ; and in secret have I said nothing . ",b.JOH.18.20,ἀπεκρίθη αὐτῷ Ἰησοῦς ἐγὼ παρρησίᾳ λελάληκα τῷ κόσμῳ ἐγὼ πάντοτε ἐδίδαξα ἐν συναγωγῇ καὶ ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ ὅπου πάντες οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι συνέρχονται καὶ ἐν κρυπτῷ ἐλάλησα οὐδέν 
b.JOH.18.21,"Why askest thou me ? ask them which heard me , what I have said unto them : behold , they know what I said . ",b.JOH.18.21,τί με ἐρωτᾷς ἐρώτησον τοὺς ἀκηκοότας τί ἐλάλησα αὐτοῖς ἴδε οὗτοι οἴδασιν ἃ εἶπον ἐγώ 
b.JOH.18.22,"And when he had thus spoken , one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand , saying , Answerest thou the high priest so ? ",b.JOH.18.22,ταῦτα δὲ αὐτοῦ εἰπόντος εἷς παρεστηκὼς τῶν ὑπηρετῶν ἔδωκεν ῥάπισμα τῷ Ἰησοῦ εἰπών οὕτως ἀποκρίνῃ τῷ ἀρχιερεῖ 
b.JOH.18.23,"Jesus answered him , If I have spoken evil , bear witness of the evil : but if well , why smitest thou me ? ",b.JOH.18.23,ἀπεκρίθη αὐτῷ Ἰησοῦς εἰ κακῶς ἐλάλησα μαρτύρησον περὶ τοῦ κακοῦ εἰ δὲ καλῶς τί με δέρεις 
b.JOH.18.24,Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest . ,b.JOH.18.24,ἀπέστειλεν οὖν αὐτὸν ὁ Ἅννας δεδεμένον πρὸς Καϊάφαν τὸν ἀρχιερέα 
b.JOH.18.25,"And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself . They said therefore unto him , Art not thou also one of his disciples ? He denied it , and said , I am not .

b.JOH.18.26,"One of the servants of the high priest , being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off , saith , Did not I see thee in the garden with him ? ",b.JOH.18.26,λέγει εἷς ἐκ τῶν δούλων τοῦ ἀρχιερέως συγγενὴς ὢν οὗ ἀπέκοψεν Πέτρος τὸ ὠτίον οὐκ ἐγώ σε εἶδον ἐν τῷ κήπῳ μετ ’ αὐτοῦ 
b.JOH.18.27,Peter then denied again : and immediately the cock crew . ,b.JOH.18.27,πάλιν οὖν ἠρνήσατο Πέτρος καὶ εὐθέως ἀλέκτωρ ἐφώνησεν 
b.JOH.18.28,"Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment : and it was early ; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall , lest they should be defiled ; but that they might eat the passover .

b.JOH.19.10,"Then saith Pilate unto him , Speakest thou not unto me ? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee , and have power to release thee ? ",b.JOH.19.10,λέγει αὐτῷ ὁ Πειλᾶτος ἐμοὶ οὐ λαλεῖς οὐκ οἶδας ὅτι ἐξουσίαν ἔχω ἀπολῦσαί σε καὶ ἐξουσίαν ἔχω σταυρῶσαί σε 
b.JOH.19.11,"Jesus answered , Thou couldest have no power at all against me , except it were given thee from above : therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin . ",b.JOH.19.11,ἀπεκρίθη Ἰησοῦς οὐκ ἔχεις ἐξουσίαν κατ ’ ἐμοῦ οὐδεμίαν εἰ μὴ ἦν δεδομένον σοι ἄνωθεν διὰ τοῦτο ὁ παραδούς μέ σοι μείζονα ἁμαρτίαν ἔχει 
b.JOH.19.12,"And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him : but the Jews cried out , saying , If thou let this man go , thou art not Caesar ' s friend : whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar . ",b.JOH.19.12,ἐκ τούτου ὁ Πειλᾶτος ἐζήτει ἀπολῦσαι αὐτόν οἱ δὲ Ἰουδαῖοι ἐκραύγαζον λέγοντες ἐὰν τοῦτον ἀπολύσῃς οὐκ εἶ φίλος τοῦ Καίσαρος πᾶς ὁ βασιλέα ἑαυτὸν ποιῶν ἀντιλέγει τῷ Καίσαρι 
b.JOH.19.13,"When Pilate therefore heard that saying , he brought Jesus forth , and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement , but in the Hebrew , Gabbatha . ",b.JOH.19.13,ὁ οὖν Πειλᾶτος ἀκούσας τῶν λόγων τούτων ἤγαγεν ἔξω τὸν Ἰησοῦν καὶ ἐκάθισεν ἐπὶ βήματος εἰς τόπον λεγόμενον Λιθόστρωτον Ἑβραϊστὶ δὲ Γαββαθᾶ 
b.JOH.19.14,"And it was the preparation of the passover , and about the sixth hour : and he saith unto the Jews , Behold your King ! ",b.JOH.19.14,ἦν δὲ παρασκευὴ τοῦ πάσχα ὥρα ἦν ὡς ἕκτη καὶ λέγει τοῖς Ἰουδαίοις ἴδε ὁ βασιλεὺς ὑμῶν 
b.JOH.19.15,"But they cried out , Away with him , away with him , crucify him . Pilate saith unto them , Shall I crucify your King ? The chief priest answered , We have no king but Caesar . ",b.JOH.19.15,ἐκραύγασαν οὖν ἐκεῖνοι ἆρον ἆρον σταύρωσον αὐτόν λέγει αὐτοῖς ὁ Πειλᾶτος τὸν βασιλέα ὑμῶν σταυρώσω ἀπεκρίθησαν οἱ ἀρχιερεῖς οὐκ ἔχομεν βασιλέα εἰ μὴ Καίσαρα 
b.JOH.19.16,"Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified . And they took Jesus , and led him away . ",b.JOH.19.16,τότε οὖν παρέδωκεν αὐτὸν αὐτοῖς ἵνα σταυρωθῇ Παρέλαβον οὖν τὸν Ἰησοῦν 
b.JOH.19.17,"And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull , which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha : ",b.JOH.19.17,καὶ βαστάζων ἑαυτῷ τὸν σταυρὸν ἐξῆλθεν εἰς τὸν λεγόμενον Κρανίου τόπον ὃ λέγεται Ἑβραϊστὶ Γολγοθᾶ 
b.JOH.19.18,"Where they crucified him , and two other with him , on either side one , and Jesus in the midst . ",b.JOH.19.18,ὅπου αὐτὸν ἐσταύρωσαν καὶ μετ ’ αὐτοῦ ἄλλους δύο ἐντεῦθεν καὶ ἐντεῦθεν μέσον δὲ τὸν Ἰησοῦν 
b.JOH.19.19,"And Pilate wrote a title , and put it on the cross . And the writing was , JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS . ",b.JOH.19.19,ἔγραψεν δὲ καὶ τίτλον ὁ Πειλᾶτος καὶ ἔθηκεν ἐπὶ τοῦ σταυροῦ ἦν δὲ γεγραμμένον Ἰησοῦς ὁ Ναζωραῖος ὁ βασιλεὺς τῶν Ἰουδαίων 
b.JOH.19.20,"This title then read many of the Jews : for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city : and it was written in Hebrew , and Greek , and Latin . ",b.JOH.19.20,τοῦτον οὖν τὸν τίτλον πολλοὶ ἀνέγνωσαν τῶν Ἰουδαίων ὅτι ἐγγὺς ἦν ὁ τόπος τῆς πόλεως ὅπου ἐσταυρώθη ὁ Ἰησοῦς καὶ ἦν γεγραμμένον Ἑβραϊστί Ῥωμαϊστί Ἑλληνιστί 
b.JOH.19.21,"Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate , Write not , The King of the Jews ; but that he said , I am King of the Jews . ",b.JOH.19.21,ἔλεγον οὖν τῷ Πειλάτῳ οἱ ἀρχιερεῖς τῶν Ἰουδαίων μὴ γράφε ὁ βασιλεὺς τῶν Ἰουδαίων ἀλλ ’ ὅτι ἐκεῖνος εἶπεν βασιλεύς εἰμι τῶν Ἰουδαίων 
b.JOH.19.22,"Pilate answered , What I have written I have written . ",b.JOH.19.22,ἀπεκρίθη ὁ Πειλᾶτος ὃ γέγραφα γέγραφα 
b.JOH.19.23,"Then the soldiers , when they had crucified Jesus , took his garments , and made four parts , to every soldier a part ; and also his coat : now the coat was without seam , woven from the top throughout . ",b.JOH.19.23,Οἱ οὖν στρατιῶται ὅτε ἐσταύρωσαν τὸν Ἰησοῦν ἔλαβον τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐποίησαν τέσσαρα μέρη ἑκάστῳ στρατιώτῃ μέρος καὶ τὸν χιτῶνα ἦν δὲ ὁ χιτὼν ἄραφος ἐκ τῶν ἄνωθεν ὑφαντὸς δι ’ ὅλου 
b.JOH.19.24,"They said therefore among themselves , Let us not rend it , but cast lots for it , whose it shall be : that the scripture might be fulfilled , which saith , They parted my raiment among them , and for my vesture they did cast lots . These things therefore the soldiers did . ",b.JOH.19.24,εἶπαν οὖν πρὸς ἀλλήλους μὴ σχίσωμεν αὐτόν ἀλλὰ λάχωμεν περὶ αὐτοῦ τίνος ἔσται ἵνα ἡ γραφὴ πληρωθῇ διεμερίσαντο τὰ ἱμάτιά μου ἑαυτοῖς καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν ἱματισμόν μου ἔβαλον κλῆρον Οἱ μὲν οὖν στρατιῶται ταῦτα ἐποίησαν 
b.JOH.19.25,"Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother , and his mother ' s sister , Mary the wife of Cleophas , and Mary Magdalene . ",b.JOH.19.25,εἱστήκεισαν δὲ παρὰ τῷ σταυρῷ τοῦ Ἰησοῦ ἡ μήτηρ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἡ ἀδελφὴ τῆς μητρὸς αὐτοῦ Μαρίαμ ἡ τοῦ Κλωπᾶ καὶ Μαρίαμ ἡ Μαγδαληνή 
b.JOH.19.26,"When Jesus therefore saw his mother , and the disciple standing by , whom he loved , he saith unto his mother , Woman , behold thy son ! ",b.JOH.19.26,Ἰησοῦς οὖν ἰδὼν τὴν μητέρα καὶ τὸν μαθητὴν παρεστῶτα ὃν ἠγάπα λέγει τῇ μητρί γύναι ἴδε ὁ υἱός σου 
b.JOH.19.27,"Then saith he to the disciple , Behold thy mother ! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home . ",b.JOH.19.27,εἶτα λέγει τῷ μαθητῇ ἴδε ἡ μήτηρ σου καὶ ἀπ ’ ἐκείνης τῆς ὥρας ἔλαβεν αὐτὴν ὁ μαθητὴς εἰς τὰ ἴδια 
b.JOH.19.28,"After this , Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished , that the scripture might be fulfilled , saith , I thirst . ",b.JOH.19.28,Μετὰ τοῦτο εἰδὼς ὁ Ἰησοῦς ὅτι ἤδη πάντα τετέλεσται ἵνα τελειωθῇ ἡ γραφή λέγει διψῶ 
b.JOH.19.29,"Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar : and they filled a spunge with vinegar , and put it upon hyssop , and put it to his mouth . ",b.JOH.19.29,σκεῦος ἔκειτο ὄξους μεστόν σπόγγον οὖν μεστὸν ὄξους ὑσσώπῳ περιθέντες προσήνεγκαν αὐτοῦ τῷ στόματι 
b.JOH.19.30,"When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar , he said , It is finished : and he bowed his head , and gave up the ghost . ",b.JOH.19.30,ὅτε οὖν ἔλαβεν τὸ ὄξος εἶπεν τετέλεσται καὶ κλίνας τὴν κεφαλὴν παρέδωκεν τὸ πνεῦμα 
b.JOH.19.31,"The Jews therefore , because it was the preparation , that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day , ( for that sabbath day was an high day , ) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken , and that they might be taken away . ",b.JOH.19.31,Οἱ οὖν Ἰουδαῖοι ἐπεὶ παρασκευὴ ἦν ἵνα μὴ μείνῃ ἐπὶ τοῦ σταυροῦ τὰ σώματα ἐν τῷ σαββάτῳ ἦν γὰρ μεγάλη ἡ ἡμέρα ἐκείνου τοῦ σαββάτου ἠρώτησαν τὸν Πειλᾶτον ἵνα κατεαγῶσιν αὐτῶν τὰ σκέλη καὶ ἀρθῶσιν 
b.JOH.19.32,"Then came the soldiers , and brake the legs of the first , and of the other which was crucified with him . ",b.JOH.19.32,ἦλθον οὖν οἱ στρατιῶται καὶ τοῦ μὲν πρώτου κατέαξαν τὰ σκέλη καὶ τοῦ ἄλλου τοῦ συνσταυρωθέντος αὐτῷ 
b.JOH.19.33,"But when they came to Jesus , and saw that he was dead already , they brake not his legs : ",b.JOH.19.33,ἐπὶ δὲ τὸν Ἰησοῦν ἐλθόντες ὡς εἶδον ἤδη αὐτὸν τεθνηκότα οὐ κατέαξαν αὐτοῦ τὰ σκέλη 
b.JOH.19.34,"But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side , and forthwith came there out blood and water . ",b.JOH.19.34,ἀλλ ’ εἷς τῶν στρατιωτῶν λόγχῃ αὐτοῦ τὴν πλευρὰν ἔνυξεν καὶ ἐξῆλθεν εὐθὺς αἷμα καὶ ὕδωρ 
b.JOH.19.35,"And he that saw it bare record , and his record is true : and he knoweth that he saith true , that ye might believe . ",b.JOH.19.35,καὶ ὁ ἑωρακὼς μεμαρτύρηκεν καὶ ἀληθινὴ αὐτοῦ ἐστιν ἡ μαρτυρία καὶ ἐκεῖνος οἶδεν ὅτι ἀληθῆ λέγει ἵνα καὶ ὑμεῖς πιστεύητε 
b.JOH.19.36,"For these things were done , that the scripture should be fulfilled , A bone of him shall not be broken . ",b.JOH.19.36,ἐγένετο γὰρ ταῦτα ἵνα ἡ γραφὴ πληρωθῇ ὀστοῦν οὐ συντριβήσεται αὐτοῦ 
b.JOH.19.37,"And again another scripture saith , They shall look on him whom they pierced . ",b.JOH.19.37,καὶ πάλιν ἑτέρα γραφὴ λέγει ὄψονται εἰς ὃν ἐξεκέντησαν 
b.JOH.19.38,"And after this Joseph of Arimathaea , being a disciple of Jesus , but secretly for fear of the Jews , besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus : and Pilate gave him leave . He came therefore , and took the body of Jesus . ",b.JOH.19.38,Μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα ἠρώτησεν τὸν Πειλᾶτον Ἰωσὴφ ὁ ἀπὸ Ἀριμαθαίας ὢν μαθητὴς τοῦ Ἰησοῦ κεκρυμμένος δὲ διὰ τὸν φόβον τῶν Ἰουδαίων ἵνα ἄρῃ τὸ σῶμα τοῦ Ἰησοῦ καὶ ἐπέτρεψεν ὁ Πειλᾶτος ἦλθεν οὖν καὶ ἦραν αὐτόν 
b.JOH.19.39,"And there came also Nicodemus , which at the first came to Jesus by night , and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes , about an hundred pound weight . ",b.JOH.19.39,ἦλθεν δὲ καὶ Νικόδημος ὁ ἐλθὼν πρὸς αὐτὸν νυκτὸς τὸ πρῶτον φέρων μίγμα σμύρνης καὶ ἀλόης ὡς λίτρας ἑκατόν 
b.JOH.19.40,"Then took they the body of Jesus , and wound it in linen clothes with the spices , as the manner of the Jews is to bury . ",b.JOH.19.40,ἔλαβον οὖν τὸ σῶμα τοῦ Ἰησοῦ καὶ ἔδησαν αὐτὸ ὀθονίοις μετὰ τῶν ἀρωμάτων καθὼς ἔθος ἐστὶν τοῖς Ἰουδαίοις ἐνταφιάζειν 
b.JOH.19.41,"Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden ; and in the garden a new sepulchre , wherein was never man yet laid . ",b.JOH.19.41,ἦν δὲ ἐν τῷ τόπῳ ὅπου ἐσταυρώθη κῆπος καὶ ἐν τῷ κήπῳ μνημεῖον καινόν ἐν ᾧ οὐδέπω οὐδεὶς ἐτέθη 
b.JOH.19.42,There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews ' preparation day ; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand . ,b.JOH.19.42,ἐκεῖ οὖν διὰ τὴν παρασκευὴν τῶν Ἰουδαίων ὅτι ἐγγὺς ἦν τὸ μνημεῖον ἔθηκαν τὸν Ἰησοῦν 
b.JOH.20.1,"The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early , when it was yet dark , unto the sepulchre , and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre . ",b.JOH.20.1,Τῇ δὲ μιᾷ τῶν σαββάτων Μαρίαμ ἡ Μαγδαληνὴ ἔρχεται πρωῒ σκοτίας ἔτι οὔσης εἰς τὸ μνημεῖον καὶ βλέπει τὸν λίθον ἠρμένον ἐκ τοῦ μνημείου 
b.JOH.20.2,"Then she runneth , and cometh to Simon Peter , and to the other disciple , whom Jesus loved , and saith unto them , They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre , and we know not where they have laid him . ",b.JOH.20.2,τρέχει οὖν καὶ ἔρχεται πρὸς Σίμωνα Πέτρον καὶ πρὸς τὸν ἄλλον μαθητὴν ὃν ἐφίλει ὁ Ἰησοῦς καὶ λέγει αὐτοῖς ἦραν τὸν κύριον ἐκ τοῦ μνημείου καὶ οὐκ οἴδαμεν ποῦ ἔθηκαν αὐτόν 
b.JOH.20.3,"Peter therefore went forth , and that other disciple , and came to the sepulchre . ",b.JOH.20.3,ἐξῆλθεν οὖν ὁ Πέτρος καὶ ὁ ἄλλος μαθητής καὶ ἤρχοντο εἰς τὸ μνημεῖον 
b.JOH.20.4,"So they ran both together : and the other disciple did outrun Peter , and came first to the sepulchre . ",b.JOH.20.4,ἔτρεχον δὲ οἱ δύο ὁμοῦ καὶ ὁ ἄλλος μαθητὴς προέδραμεν τάχιον τοῦ Πέτρου καὶ ἦλθεν πρῶτος εἰς τὸ μνημεῖον 
b.JOH.20.5,"And he stooping down , and looking in , saw the linen clothes lying ; yet went he not in . ",b.JOH.20.5,καὶ παρακύψας βλέπει κείμενα τὰ ὀθόνια οὐ μέντοι εἰσῆλθεν 
b.JOH.20.6,"Then cometh Simon Peter following him , and went into the sepulchre , and seeth the linen clothes lie , ",b.JOH.20.6,ἔρχεται οὖν Σίμων Πέτρος ἀκολουθῶν αὐτῷ καὶ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὸ μνημεῖον καὶ θεωρεῖ τὰ ὀθόνια κείμενα

b.JOH.20.9,"For as yet they knew not the scripture , that he must rise again from the dead . ",b.JOH.20.9,οὐδέπω γὰρ ᾔδεισαν τὴν γραφὴν ὅτι δεῖ αὐτὸν ἐκ νεκρῶν ἀναστῆναι 
b.JOH.20.10,Then the disciples went away again unto their own home . ,b.JOH.20.10,ἀπῆλθον οὖν πάλιν πρὸς αὐτοὺς οἱ μαθηταί 
b.JOH.20.11,"But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping : and as she wept , she stooped down , and looked into the sepulchre , ",b.JOH.20.11,Μαρὶαμ δὲ εἱστήκει πρὸς τῷ μνημείῳ ἔξω κλαίουσα ὡς οὖν ἔκλαιεν παρέκυψεν εἰς τὸ μνημεῖον 
b.JOH.20.12,"And seeth two angels in white sitting , the one at the head , and the other at the feet , where the body of Jesus had lain . ",b.JOH.20.12,καὶ θεωρεῖ δύο ἀγγέλους ἐν λευκοῖς καθεζομένους ἕνα πρὸς τῇ κεφαλῇ καὶ ἕνα πρὸς τοῖς ποσίν ὅπου ἔκειτο τὸ σῶμα τοῦ Ἰησοῦ 
b.JOH.20.13,"And they say unto her , Woman , why weepest thou ? She saith unto them , Because they have taken away my Lord , and I know not where they have laid him . ",b.JOH.20.13,λέγουσιν αὐτῇ ἐκεῖνοι γύναι τί κλαίεις λέγει αὐτοῖς ὅτι ἦραν τὸν κύριόν μου καὶ οὐκ οἶδα ποῦ ἔθηκαν αὐτόν 
b.JOH.20.14,"And when she had thus said , she turned herself back , and saw Jesus standing , and knew not that it was Jesus . ",b.JOH.20.14,ταῦτα εἰποῦσα ἐστράφη εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω καὶ θεωρεῖ τὸν Ἰησοῦν ἑστῶτα καὶ οὐκ ᾔδει ὅτι Ἰησοῦς ἐστιν 
b.JOH.20.15,"Jesus saith unto her , Woman , why weepest thou ? whom seekest thou ? She , supposing him to be the gardener , saith unto him , Sir , if thou have borne him hence , tell me where thou hast laid him , and I will take him away .

b.JOH.20.19,"Then the same day at evening , being the first day of the week , when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews , came Jesus and stood in the midst , and saith unto them , Peace be unto you .

b.JOH.20.26,"And after eight days again his disciples were within , and Thomas with them : then came Jesus , the doors being shut , and stood in the midst , and said , Peace be unto you .

b.JOH.21.1,After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias ; and on this wise shewed he himself . ,b.JOH.21.1,Μετὰ ταῦτα ἐφανέρωσεν ἑαυτὸν πάλιν Ἰησοῦς τοῖς μαθηταῖς ἐπὶ τῆς θαλάσσης τῆς Τιβεριάδος ἐφανέρωσεν δὲ οὕτως

b.JOH.21.7,"Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter , It is the Lord . Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord , he girt his fisher ' s coat unto him , ( for he was naked , ) and did cast himself into the sea .

b.HEB.4.6,"Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein , and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief : ",b.HEB.4.6,ἐπεὶ οὖν ἀπολείπεται τινὰς εἰσελθεῖν εἰς αὐτήν καὶ οἱ πρότερον εὐαγγελισθέντες οὐκ εἰσῆλθον δι ’ ἀπείθειαν 
b.HEB.4.7,"Again , he limiteth a certain day , saying in David , To day , after so long a time ; as it is said , To day if ye will hear his voice , harden not your hearts . ",b.HEB.4.7,πάλιν τινὰ ὁρίζει ἡμέραν σήμερον ἐν Δαυεὶδ λέγων μετὰ τοσοῦτον χρόνον καθὼς προείρηται σήμερον ἐὰν τῆς φωνῆς αὐτοῦ ἀκούσητε μὴ σκληρύνητε τὰς καρδίας ὑμῶν 
b.HEB.4.8,"For if Jesus had given them rest , then would he not afterward have spoken of another day . ",b.HEB.4.8,εἰ γὰρ αὐτοὺς Ἰησοῦς κατέπαυσεν οὐκ ἂν περὶ ἄλλης ἐλάλει μετὰ ταῦτα ἡμέρας 
b.HEB.4.9,There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God . ,b.HEB.4.9,ἄρα ἀπολείπεται σαββατισμὸς τῷ λαῷ τοῦ θεοῦ 
b.HEB.4.10,"For he that is entered into his rest , he also hath ceased from his own works , as God did from his . ",b.HEB.4.10,ὁ γὰρ εἰσελθὼν εἰς τὴν κατάπαυσιν αὐτοῦ καὶ αὐτὸς κατέπαυσεν ἀπὸ τῶν ἔργων αὐτοῦ ὥσπερ ἀπὸ τῶν ἰδίων ὁ θεός 
b.HEB.4.11,"Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest , lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief . ",b.HEB.4.11,σπουδάσωμεν οὖν εἰσελθεῖν εἰς ἐκείνην τὴν κατάπαυσιν ἵνα μὴ ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ τις ὑποδείγματι πέσῃ τῆς ἀπειθείας 
b.HEB.4.12,"For the word of God is quick , and powerful , and sharper than any twoedged sword , piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit , and of the joints and marrow , and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart . ",b.HEB.4.12,ζῶν γὰρ ὁ λόγος τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ ἐνεργὴς καὶ τομώτερος ὑπὲρ πᾶσαν μάχαιραν δίστομον καὶ διϊκνούμενος ἄχρι μερισμοῦ ψυχῆς καὶ πνεύματος ἁρμῶν τε καὶ μυελῶν καὶ κριτικὸς ἐνθυμήσεων καὶ ἐννοιῶν καρδίας 
b.HEB.4.13,Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight : but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do . ,b.HEB.4.13,καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν κτίσις ἀφανὴς ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ πάντα δὲ γυμνὰ καὶ τετραχηλισμένα τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς αὐτοῦ ,b.HEB.4.13,Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight : but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do . ,b.HEB.4.13,πρὸς ὃν ἡμῖν ὁ λόγος 
b.HEB.4.13,Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight : but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do . ,b.HEB.4.13,καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν κτίσις ἀφανὴς ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ πάντα δὲ γυμνὰ καὶ τετραχηλισμένα τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς αὐτοῦ ,b.HEB.4.13,Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight : but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do . ,b.HEB.4.13,πρὸς ὃν ἡμῖν ὁ λόγος 
b.HEB.4.14,"Seeing then that we have a great high priest , that is passed into the heavens , Jesus the Son of God , let us hold fast our profession . ",b.HEB.4.14,ἔχοντες οὖν ἀρχιερέα μέγαν διεληλυθότα τοὺς οὐρανούς Ἰησοῦν τὸν υἱὸν τοῦ θεοῦ κρατῶμεν τῆς ὁμολογίας 
b.HEB.4.15,"For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities ; but was in all points tempted like as we are , yet without sin . ",b.HEB.4.15,οὐ γὰρ ἔχομεν ἀρχιερέα μὴ δυνάμενον συνπαθῆσαι ταῖς ἀσθενείαις ἡμῶν πεπειρασμένον δὲ κατὰ πάντα καθ ’ ὁμοιότητα χωρὶς ἁμαρτίας 
b.HEB.4.16,"Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace , that we may obtain mercy , and find grace to help in time of need . ",b.HEB.4.16,προσερχώμεθα οὖν μετὰ παρρησίας τῷ θρόνῳ τῆς χάριτος ἵνα λάβωμεν ἔλεος καὶ χάριν εὕρωμεν εἰς εὔκαιρον βοήθειαν 
b.HEB.5.1,"For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God , that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins : ",b.HEB.5.1,Πᾶς γὰρ ἀρχιερεὺς ἐξ ἀνθρώπων λαμβανόμενος ὑπὲρ ἀνθρώπων καθίσταται τὰ πρὸς τὸν θεόν ἵνα προσφέρῃ δῶρά τε καὶ θυσίας ὑπὲρ ἁμαρτιῶν 
b.HEB.5.2,"Who can have compassion on the ignorant , and on them that are out of the way ; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity . ",b.HEB.5.2,μετριοπαθεῖν δυνάμενος τοῖς ἀγνοοῦσιν καὶ πλανωμένοις ἐπεὶ καὶ αὐτὸς περίκειται ἀσθένειαν 
b.HEB.5.3,"And by reason hereof he ought , as for the people , so also for himself , to offer for sins . ",b.HEB.5.3,καὶ δι ’ αὐτὴν ὀφείλει καθὼς περὶ τοῦ λαοῦ οὕτως καὶ περὶ ἑαυτοῦ προσφέρειν περὶ ἁμαρτιῶν 
b.HEB.5.4,"And no man taketh this honour unto himself , but he that is called of God , as was Aaron . ",b.HEB.5.4,καὶ οὐχ ἑαυτῷ τις λαμβάνει τὴν τιμήν ἀλλὰ καλούμενος ὑπὸ τοῦ θεοῦ καθώσπερ καὶ Ἀαρών 
b.HEB.5.5,"So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest ; but he that said unto him , Thou art my Son , to day have I begotten thee . ",b.HEB.5.5,οὕτως καὶ ὁ Χριστὸς οὐχ ἑαυτὸν ἐδόξασεν γενηθῆναι ἀρχιερέα ἀλλ ’ ὁ λαλήσας πρὸς αὐτόν ,b.HEB.5.5,"So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest ; but he that said unto him , Thou art my Son , to day have I begotten thee . ",b.HEB.5.5,υἱός μου εἶ σύ ἐγὼ σήμερον γεγέννηκά σε 
b.HEB.5.5,"So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest ; but he that said unto him , Thou art my Son , to day have I begotten thee . ",b.HEB.5.5,οὕτως καὶ ὁ Χριστὸς οὐχ ἑαυτὸν ἐδόξασεν γενηθῆναι ἀρχιερέα ἀλλ ’ ὁ λαλήσας πρὸς αὐτόν ,b.HEB.5.5,"So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest ; but he that said unto him , Thou art my Son , to day have I begotten thee .

b.HEB.5.6,"As he saith also in another place , Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec . ",b.HEB.5.6,καθὼς καὶ ἐν ἑτέρῳ λέγει σὺ ἱερεὺς εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα κατὰ τὴν τάξιν Μελχισέδεκ 
b.HEB.5.7,"Who in the days of his flesh , when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death , and was heard in that he feared ; ",b.HEB.5.7,ὃς ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις τῆς σαρκὸς αὐτοῦ δεήσεις τε καὶ ἱκετηρίας πρὸς τὸν δυνάμενον σῴζειν αὐτὸν ἐκ θανάτου μετὰ κραυγῆς ἰσχυρᾶς καὶ δακρύων προσενέγκας καὶ εἰσακουσθεὶς ἀπὸ τῆς εὐλαβείας 
b.HEB.5.8,"Though he were a Son , yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered ; ",b.HEB.5.8,καίπερ ὢν υἱὸς ἔμαθεν ἀφ ’ ὧν ἔπαθεν τὴν ὑπακοήν 
b.HEB.5.9,"And being made perfect , he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him ; ",b.HEB.5.9,καὶ τελειωθεὶς ἐγένετο πᾶσιν τοῖς ὑπακούουσιν αὐτῷ αἴτιος σωτηρίας αἰωνίου 
b.HEB.5.10,Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec . ,b.HEB.5.10,προσαγορευθεὶς ὑπὸ τοῦ θεοῦ ἀρχιερεὺς κατὰ τὴν τάξιν Μελχισέδεκ 
b.HEB.5.11,"Of whom we have many things to say , and hard to be uttered , seeing ye are dull of hearing . ",b.HEB.5.11,Περὶ οὗ πολὺς ἡμῖν ὁ λόγος καὶ δυσερμήνευτος λέγειν ἐπεὶ νωθροὶ γεγόνατε ταῖς ἀκοαῖς 
b.HEB.5.12,"For when for the time ye ought to be teachers , ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God ; and are become such as have need of milk , and not of strong meat . ",b.HEB.5.12,καὶ γὰρ ὀφείλοντες εἶναι διδάσκαλοι διὰ τὸν χρόνον πάλιν χρείαν ἔχετε τοῦ διδάσκειν ὑμᾶς τινὰ τὰ στοιχεῖα τῆς ἀρχῆς τῶν λογίων τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ γεγόνατε χρείαν ἔχοντες γάλακτος οὐ στερεᾶς τροφῆς 
b.HEB.5.13,For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness : for he is a babe . ,b.HEB.5.13,πᾶς γὰρ ὁ μετέχων γάλακτος ἄπειρος λόγου δικαιοσύνης ,b.HEB.5.13,For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness : for he is a babe . ,b.HEB.5.13,νήπιος γάρ ἐστιν 
b.HEB.5.13,For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness : for he is a babe . ,b.HEB.5.13,πᾶς γὰρ ὁ μετέχων γάλακτος ἄπειρος λόγου δικαιοσύνης ,b.HEB.5.13,For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness : for he is a babe . ,b.HEB.5.13,νήπιος γάρ ἐστιν 
b.HEB.5.14,"But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age , even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil . ",b.HEB.5.14,τελείων δέ ἐστιν ἡ στερεὰ τροφή τῶν διὰ τὴν ἕξιν τὰ αἰσθητήρια γεγυμνασμένα ἐχόντων πρὸς διάκρισιν καλοῦ τε καὶ κακοῦ 
b.HEB.6.1,"Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ , let us go on unto perfection ; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works , and of faith toward God , ",b.HEB.6.1,Διὸ ἀφέντες τὸν τῆς ἀρχῆς τοῦ Χριστοῦ λόγον ἐπὶ τὴν τελειότητα φερώμεθα μὴ πάλιν θεμέλιον καταβαλλόμενοι μετανοίας ἀπὸ νεκρῶν ἔργων καὶ πίστεως ἐπὶ θεόν 
b.HEB.6.2,"Of the doctrine of baptisms , and of laying on of hands , and of resurrection of the dead , and of eternal judgment . ",b.HEB.6.2,βαπτισμῶν διδαχῆς ἐπιθέσεώς τε χειρῶν ἀναστάσεώς τε νεκρῶν καὶ κρίματος αἰωνίου 
b.HEB.6.3,"And this will we do , if God permit . ",b.HEB.6.3,καὶ τοῦτο ποιήσομεν ἐάνπερ ἐπιτρέπῃ ὁ θεός 
b.HEB.6.4,"For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened , and have tasted of the heavenly gift , and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost , ",b.HEB.6.4,ἀδύνατον γὰρ τοὺς ἅπαξ φωτισθέντας γευσαμένους τε τῆς δωρεᾶς τῆς ἐπουρανίου καὶ μετόχους γενηθέντας πνεύματος ἁγίου

b.HEB.6.7,"For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it , and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed , receiveth blessing from God : ",b.HEB.6.7,γῆ γὰρ ἡ πιοῦσα τὸν ἐπ ’ αὐτῆς ἐρχόμενον πολλάκις ὑετόν καὶ τίκτουσα βοτάνην εὔθετον ἐκείνοις δι ’ οὓς καὶ γεωργεῖται μεταλαμβάνει εὐλογίας ἀπὸ τοῦ θεοῦ

b.HEB.6.9,"But , beloved , we are persuaded better things of you , and things that accompany salvation , though we thus speak . ",b.HEB.6.9,Πεπείσμεθα δὲ περὶ ὑμῶν ἀγαπητοί τὰ κρείσσονα καὶ ἐχόμενα σωτηρίας εἰ καὶ οὕτως λαλοῦμεν 
b.HEB.6.10,"For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love , which ye have shewed toward his name , in that ye have ministered to the saints , and do minister . ",b.HEB.6.10,οὐ γὰρ ἄδικος ὁ θεὸς ἐπιλαθέσθαι τοῦ ἔργου ὑμῶν καὶ τῆς ἀγάπης ἧς ἐνεδείξασθε εἰς τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ διακονήσαντες τοῖς ἁγίοις καὶ διακονοῦντες 
b.HEB.6.11,And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end : ,b.HEB.6.11,ἐπιθυμοῦμεν δὲ ἕκαστον ὑμῶν τὴν αὐτὴν ἐνδείκνυσθαι σπουδὴν πρὸς τὴν πληροφορίαν τῆς ἐλπίδος ἄχρι τέλους 
b.HEB.6.12,"That ye be not slothful , but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises . ",b.HEB.6.12,ἵνα μὴ νωθροὶ γένησθε μιμηταὶ δὲ τῶν διὰ πίστεως καὶ μακροθυμίας κληρονομούντων τὰς ἐπαγγελίας 
b.HEB.6.13,"For when God made promise to Abraham , because he could swear by no greater , he sware by himself , ",b.HEB.6.13,τῷ γὰρ Ἀβραὰμ ἐπαγγειλάμενος ὁ θεός ἐπεὶ κατ ’ οὐδενὸς εἶχεν μείζονος ὀμόσαι ὤμοσεν καθ ’ ἑαυτοῦ 
b.HEB.6.14,"Saying , Surely blessing I will bless thee , and multiplying I will multiply thee . ",b.HEB.6.14,λέγων εἰ μὴν εὐλογῶν εὐλογήσω σε καὶ πληθύνων πληθυνῶ σε 
b.HEB.6.15,"And so , after he had patiently endured , he obtained the promise . ",b.HEB.6.15,καὶ οὕτως μακροθυμήσας ἐπέτυχεν τῆς ἐπαγγελίας 
b.HEB.6.16,For men verily swear by the greater : and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife . ,b.HEB.6.16,ἄνθρωποι γὰρ κατὰ τοῦ μείζονος ὀμνύουσιν καὶ πάσης αὐτοῖς ἀντιλογίας πέρας εἰς βεβαίωσιν ὁ ὅρκος 
b.HEB.6.17,"Wherein God , willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel , confirmed it by an oath : ",b.HEB.6.17,ἐν ᾧ περισσότερον βουλόμενος ὁ θεὸς ἐπιδεῖξαι τοῖς κληρονόμοις τῆς ἐπαγγελίας τὸ ἀμετάθετον τῆς βουλῆς αὐτοῦ ἐμεσίτευσεν ὅρκῳ 
b.HEB.6.18,"That by two immutable things , in which it was impossible for God to lie , we might have a strong consolation , who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us : ",b.HEB.6.18,ἵνα διὰ δύο πραγμάτων ἀμεταθέτων ἐν οἷς ἀδύνατον ψεύσασθαι τὸν θεόν ἰσχυρὰν παράκλησιν ἔχωμεν οἱ καταφυγόντες κρατῆσαι τῆς προκειμένης ἐλπίδος 
b.HEB.6.19,"Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul , both sure and stedfast , and which entereth into that within the veil ; ",b.HEB.6.19,ἣν ὡς ἄγκυραν ἔχομεν τῆς ψυχῆς ἀσφαλῆ τε καὶ βεβαίαν καὶ εἰσερχομένην εἰς τὸ ἐσώτερον τοῦ καταπετάσματος 
b.HEB.6.20,"Whither the forerunner is for us entered , even Jesus , made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec . ",b.HEB.6.20,ὅπου πρόδρομος ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν εἰσῆλθεν Ἰησοῦς κατὰ τὴν τάξιν Μελχισέδεκ ἀρχιερεὺς γενόμενος εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα 
b.HEB.7.1,"For this Melchisedec , king of Salem , priest of the most high God , who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings , and blessed him ; ",b.HEB.7.1,Οὗτος γὰρ ὁ Μελχισέδεκ βασιλεὺς Σαλήμ ἱερεὺς τοῦ θεοῦ τοῦ ὑψίστου ὁ συναντήσας Ἀβραὰμ ὑποστρέφοντι ἀπὸ τῆς κοπῆς τῶν βασιλέων καὶ εὐλογήσας αὐτόν 
b.HEB.7.2,"To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all ; first being by interpretation King of righteousness , and after that also King of Salem , which is , King of peace ; ",b.HEB.7.2,ᾧ καὶ δεκάτην ἀπὸ πάντων ἐμέρισεν Ἀβραάμ πρῶτον μὲν ἑρμηνευόμενος βασιλεὺς δικαιοσύνης ἔπειτα δὲ καὶ βασιλεὺς Σαλήμ ὅ ἐστιν βασιλεὺς εἰρήνης 
b.HEB.7.3,"Without father , without mother , without descent , having neither beginning of days , nor end of life ; but made like unto the Son of God ; abideth a priest continually . ",b.HEB.7.3,ἀπάτωρ ἀμήτωρ ἀγενεαλόγητος μήτε ἀρχὴν ἡμερῶν μήτε ζωῆς τέλος ἔχων ἀφωμοιωμένος δὲ τῷ υἱῷ τοῦ θεοῦ μένει ἱερεὺς εἰς τὸ διηνεκές 
b.HEB.7.4,"Now consider how great this man was , unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils . ",b.HEB.7.4,Θεωρεῖτε δὲ πηλίκος οὗτος ᾧ καὶ δεκάτην Ἀβραὰμ ἔδωκεν ἐκ τῶν ἀκροθινίων ὁ πατριάρχης 
b.HEB.7.5,"And verily they that are of the sons of Levi , who receive the office of the priesthood , have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law , that is , of their brethren , though they come out of the loins of Abraham : ",b.HEB.7.5,καὶ οἱ μὲν ἐκ τῶν υἱῶν Λευεὶ τὴν ἱερατείαν λαμβάνοντες ἐντολὴν ἔχουσιν ἀποδεκατοῦν τὸν λαὸν κατὰ τὸν νόμον τοῦτ ’ ἔστιν τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτῶν καίπερ ἐξεληλυθότας ἐκ τῆς ὀσφύος Ἀβραάμ 
b.HEB.7.6,"But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham , and blessed him that had the promises . ",b.HEB.7.6,ὁ δὲ μὴ γενεαλογούμενος ἐξ αὐτῶν δεδεκάτωκεν Ἀβραάμ καὶ τὸν ἔχοντα τὰς ἐπαγγελίας εὐλόγηκεν 
b.HEB.7.7,And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better . ,b.HEB.7.7,χωρὶς δὲ πάσης ἀντιλογίας τὸ ἔλαττον ὑπὸ τοῦ κρείττονος εὐλογεῖται 
b.HEB.7.8,"And here men that die receive tithes ; but there he receiveth them , of whom it is witnessed that he liveth . ",b.HEB.7.8,καὶ ὧδε μὲν δεκάτας ἀποθνῄσκοντες ἄνθρωποι λαμβάνουσιν ἐκεῖ δὲ μαρτυρούμενος ὅτι ζῇ 
b.HEB.7.9,"And as I may so say , Levi also , who receiveth tithes , payed tithes in Abraham . ",b.HEB.7.9,καὶ ὡς ἔπος εἰπεῖν διὰ Ἀβραὰμ καὶ Λευεὶς ὁ δεκάτας λαμβάνων δεδεκάτωται 
b.HEB.7.10,"For he was yet in the loins of his father , when Melchisedec met him . ",b.HEB.7.10,ἔτι γὰρ ἐν τῇ ὀσφύϊ τοῦ πατρὸς ἦν ὅτε συνήντησεν αὐτῷ ὁ Μελχισεδέκ 
b.HEB.7.11,"If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood , ( for under it the people received the law , ) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec , and not be called after the order of Aaron ? ",b.HEB.7.11,Εἰ μὲν οὖν τελείωσις διὰ τῆς Λευειτικῆς ἱερωσύνης ἦν ὁ λαὸς γὰρ ἐπ ’ αὐτῆς νενομοθέτηται τίς ἔτι χρεία κατὰ τὴν τάξιν Μελχισεδὲκ ἕτερον ἀνίστασθαι ἱερέα καὶ οὐ κατὰ τὴν τάξιν Ἀαρὼν λέγεσθαι 
b.HEB.7.12,"For the priesthood being changed , there is made of necessity a change also of the law . ",b.HEB.7.12,μετατιθεμένης γὰρ τῆς ἱερωσύνης ἐξ ἀνάγκης καὶ νόμου μετάθεσις γίνεται 
b.HEB.7.13,"For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe , of which no man gave attendance at the altar . ",b.HEB.7.13,ἐφ ’ ὃν γὰρ λέγεται ταῦτα φυλῆς ἑτέρας μετέσχηκεν ἀφ ’ ἧς οὐδεὶς προσέσχηκεν τῷ θυσιαστηρίῳ 
b.HEB.7.14,For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda ; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood . ,b.HEB.7.14,πρόδηλον γὰρ ὅτι ἐξ Ἰούδα ἀνατέταλκεν ὁ κύριος ἡμῶν εἰς ἣν φυλὴν περὶ ἱερέων οὐδὲν Μωϋσῆς ἐλάλησεν 
b.HEB.7.15,"And it is yet far more evident : for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest , ",b.HEB.7.15,καὶ περισσότερον ἔτι κατάδηλόν ἐστιν εἰ κατὰ τὴν ὁμοιότητα Μελχισέδεκ ἀνίσταται ἱερεὺς ἕτερος 
b.HEB.7.16,"Who is made , not after the law of a carnal commandment , but after the power of an endless life . ",b.HEB.7.16,ὃς οὐ κατὰ νόμον ἐντολῆς σαρκίνης γέγονεν ἀλλὰ κατὰ δύναμιν ζωῆς ἀκαταλύτου 
b.HEB.7.17,"For he testifieth , Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec . ",b.HEB.7.17,μαρτυρεῖται γὰρ ὅτι σὺ ἱερεὺς εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα κατὰ τὴν τάξιν Μελχισέδεκ 
b.HEB.7.18,For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof . ,b.HEB.7.18,Ἀθέτησις μὲν γὰρ γίνεται προαγούσης ἐντολῆς διὰ τὸ αὐτῆς ἀσθενὲς καὶ ἀνωφελές 
b.HEB.7.19,"For the law made nothing perfect , but the bringing in of a better hope did ; by the which we draw nigh unto God . ",b.HEB.7.19,οὐδὲν γὰρ ἐτελείωσεν ὁ νόμος ἐπεισαγωγὴ δὲ κρείττονος ἐλπίδος δι ’ ἧς ἐγγίζομεν τῷ θεῷ 
b.HEB.7.20,And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest : ,b.HEB.7.20,καὶ καθ ’ ὅσον οὐ χωρὶς ὁρκωμοσίας οἱ μὲν γὰρ χωρὶς ὁρκωμοσίας εἰσὶν ἱερεῖς γεγονότες 
b.HEB.7.21," ( For those priests were made without an oath ; but this with an oath by him that said unto him , The Lord sware and will not repent , Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec : ) ",b.HEB.7.21,ὁ δὲ μετὰ ὁρκωμοσίας διὰ τοῦ λέγοντος πρὸς αὐτόν ὤμοσεν κύριος καὶ οὐ μεταμεληθήσεται σὺ ἱερεὺς εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα 
b.HEB.7.22,By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament . ,b.HEB.7.22,κατὰ τοσοῦτο καὶ κρείττονος διαθήκης γέγονεν ἔγγυος Ἰησοῦς 
b.HEB.7.23,"And they truly were many priests , because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death : ",b.HEB.7.23,καὶ οἱ μὲν πλείονές εἰσιν γεγονότες ἱερεῖς διὰ τὸ θανάτῳ κωλύεσθαι παραμένειν 
b.HEB.7.24,"But this man , because he continueth ever , hath an unchangeable priesthood . ",b.HEB.7.24,ὁ δὲ διὰ τὸ μένειν αὐτὸν εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα ἀπαράβατον ἔχει τὴν ἱερωσύνην 
b.HEB.7.25,"Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him , seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them . ",b.HEB.7.25,ὅθεν καὶ σῴζειν εἰς τὸ παντελὲς δύναται τοὺς προσερχομένους δι ’ αὐτοῦ τῷ θεῷ πάντοτε ζῶν εἰς τὸ ἐντυγχάνειν ὑπὲρ αὐτῶν 
b.HEB.7.26,"For such an high priest became us , who is holy , harmless , undefiled , separate from sinners , and made higher than the heavens ; ",b.HEB.7.26,Τοιοῦτος γὰρ ὑμῖν καὶ ἔπρεπεν ἀρχιερεύς ὅσιος ἄκακος ἀμίαντος κεχωρισμένος ἀπὸ τῶν ἁμαρτωλῶν καὶ ὑψηλότερος τῶν οὐρανῶν γενόμενος

",b.HEB.7.27,τοῦτο γὰρ ἐποίησεν ἐφάπαξ ἑαυτὸν προσενέγκας 
b.HEB.7.28,"For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity ; but the word of the oath , which was since the law , maketh the Son , who is consecrated for evermore .

b.HEB.8.1,"Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum : We have such an high priest , who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens ; ",b.HEB.8.1,Κεφάλαιον δὲ ἐπὶ τοῖς λεγομένοις ,b.HEB.8.1,"Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum : We have such an high priest , who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens ; ",b.HEB.8.1,τοιοῦτον ἔχομεν ἀρχιερέα ὃς ἐκάθισεν ἐν δεξιᾷ τοῦ θρόνου τῆς μεγαλωσύνης ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς 
b.HEB.8.1,"Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum : We have such an high priest , who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens ; ",b.HEB.8.1,Κεφάλαιον δὲ ἐπὶ τοῖς λεγομένοις ,b.HEB.8.1,"Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum : We have such an high priest , who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens ; ",b.HEB.8.1,τοιοῦτον ἔχομεν ἀρχιερέα ὃς ἐκάθισεν ἐν δεξιᾷ τοῦ θρόνου τῆς μεγαλωσύνης ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς 
b.HEB.8.2,"A minister of the sanctuary , and of the true tabernacle , which the Lord pitched , and not man . ",b.HEB.8.2,τῶν ἁγίων λειτουργὸς καὶ τῆς σκηνῆς τῆς ἀληθινῆς ἣν ἔπηξεν ὁ κύριος οὐκ ἄνθρωπος 
b.HEB.8.3,For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices : wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer . ,b.HEB.8.3,πᾶς γὰρ ἀρχιερεὺς εἰς τὸ προσφέρειν δῶρά τε καὶ θυσίας καθίσταται ὅθεν ἀναγκαῖον ἔχειν τι καὶ τοῦτον ὃ προσενέγκῃ 
b.HEB.8.4,"For if he were on earth , he should not be a priest , seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law : ",b.HEB.8.4,εἰ μὲν οὖν ἦν ἐπὶ γῆς οὐδ ’ ἂν ἦν ἱερεύς ὄντων τῶν προσφερόντων κατὰ νόμον τὰ δῶρα 
b.HEB.8.5,"Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things , as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle : for , See , saith he , that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount . ",b.HEB.8.5,οἵτινες ὑποδείγματι καὶ σκιᾷ λατρεύουσιν τῶν ἐπουρανίων καθὼς κεχρημάτισται Μωϋσῆς μέλλων ἐπιτελεῖν τὴν σκηνήν ὅρα γάρ φησίν ποιήσεις πάντα κατὰ τὸν τύπον τὸν δειχθέντα σοι ἐν τῷ ὄρει 
b.HEB.8.6,"But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry , by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant , which was established upon better promises . ",b.HEB.8.6,νυνὶ δὲ διαφορωτέρας τέτυχεν λειτουργίας ὅσῳ καὶ κρείττονός ἐστιν διαθήκης μεσίτης ἥτις ἐπὶ κρείττοσιν ἐπαγγελίαις νενομοθέτηται 
b.HEB.8.7,"For if that first covenant had been faultless , then should no place have been sought for the second . ",b.HEB.8.7,Εἰ γὰρ ἡ πρώτη ἐκείνη ἦν ἄμεμπτος οὐκ ἂν δευτέρας ἐζητεῖτο τόπος 
b.HEB.8.8,"For finding fault with them , he saith , Behold , the days come , saith the Lord , when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah : ",b.HEB.8.8,μεμφόμενος γὰρ αὐτοὺς λέγει ἰδοὺ ἡμέραι ἔρχονται λέγει κύριος καὶ συντελέσω ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον Ἰσραὴλ καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον Ἰούδα διαθήκην καινήν 
b.HEB.8.9,"Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt ; because they continued not in my covenant , and I regarded them not , saith the Lord .

b.HEB.8.10,"For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days , saith the Lord ; I will put my laws into their mind , and write them in their hearts : and I will be to them a God , and they shall be to me a people : ",b.HEB.8.10,ὅτι αὕτη ἡ διαθήκη ἣν διαθήσομαι τῷ οἴκῳ Ἰσραὴλ μετὰ τὰς ἡμέρας ἐκείνας ,b.HEB.8.10,"For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days , saith the Lord ; I will put my laws into their mind , and write them in their hearts : and I will be to them a God , and they shall be to me a people : ",b.HEB.8.10,λέγει κύριος διδοὺς νόμους μου εἰς τὴν διάνοιαν αὐτῶν καὶ ἐπὶ καρδίαν αὐτῶν ἐπιγράψω αὐτούς καὶ ἔσομαι αὐτοῖς εἰς θεὸν καὶ αὐτοὶ ἔσονταί μοι εἰς λαόν

b.HEB.8.11,"And they shall not teach every man his neighbour , and every man his brother , saying , Know the Lord : for all shall know me , from the least to the greatest .

",b.HEB.8.11,γνῶθι τὸν κύριον ὅτι πάντες εἰδήσουσίν με ἀπὸ μικροῦ ἕως μεγάλου αὐτῶν 
b.HEB.8.12,"For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness , and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more . ",b.HEB.8.12,ὅτι ἵλεως ἔσομαι ταῖς ἀδικίαις αὐτῶν καὶ τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν αὐτῶν οὐ μὴ μνησθῶ ἔτι 
b.HEB.8.13,"In that he saith , A new covenant , he hath made the first old . Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away . ",b.HEB.8.13,ἐν τῷ λέγειν καινὴν πεπαλαίωκεν τὴν πρώτην τὸ δὲ παλαιούμενον καὶ γηράσκον ἐγγὺς ἀφανισμοῦ 
b.HEB.9.1,"Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service , and a worldly sanctuary . ",b.HEB.9.1,Εἶχε μὲν οὖν καὶ ἡ πρώτη δικαιώματα λατρείας τό τε ἅγιον κοσμικόν 
b.HEB.9.2,"For there was a tabernacle made ; the first , wherein was the candlestick , and the table , and the shewbread ; which is called the sanctuary . ",b.HEB.9.2,σκηνὴ γὰρ κατεσκευάσθη ἡ πρώτη ἐν ᾗ ἥ τε λυχνία καὶ ἡ τράπεζα καὶ ἡ πρόθεσις τῶν ἄρτων ἥτις λέγεται ἅγια 
b.HEB.9.3,"And after the second veil , the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all ; ",b.HEB.9.3,μετὰ δὲ τὸ δεύτερον καταπέτασμα σκηνὴ ἡ λεγομένη ἅγια ἁγίων 
b.HEB.9.4,"Which had the golden censer , and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold , wherein was the golden pot that had manna , and Aaron ' s rod that budded , and the tables of the covenant ; ",b.HEB.9.4,χρυσοῦν ἔχουσα θυμιατήριον καὶ τὴν κιβωτὸν τῆς διαθήκης περικεκαλυμμένην πάντοθεν χρυσίῳ ἐν ᾗ στάμνος χρυσῆ ἔχουσα τὸ μάννα καὶ ἡ ῥάβδος Ἀαρὼν ἡ βλαστήσασα καὶ αἱ πλάκες τῆς διαθήκης 
b.HEB.9.5,And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat ; of which we cannot now speak particularly . ,b.HEB.9.5,ὑπεράνω δὲ αὐτῆς Χερουβεὶν δόξης κατασκιάζοντα τὸ ἱλαστήριον ,b.HEB.9.5,And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat ; of which we cannot now speak particularly . ,b.HEB.9.5,περὶ ὧν οὐκ ἔστιν νῦν λέγειν κατὰ μέρος 
b.HEB.9.5,And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat ; of which we cannot now speak particularly . ,b.HEB.9.5,ὑπεράνω δὲ αὐτῆς Χερουβεὶν δόξης κατασκιάζοντα τὸ ἱλαστήριον ,b.HEB.9.5,And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat ; of which we cannot now speak particularly . ,b.HEB.9.5,περὶ ὧν οὐκ ἔστιν νῦν λέγειν κατὰ μέρος 
b.HEB.9.6,"Now when these things were thus ordained , the priests went always into the first tabernacle , accomplishing the service of God . ",b.HEB.9.6,Τούτων δὲ οὕτως κατεσκευασμένων εἰς μὲν τὴν πρώτην σκηνὴν διαπαντὸς εἰσίασιν οἱ ἱερεῖς τὰς λατρείας ἐπιτελοῦντες 
b.HEB.9.7,"But into the second went the high priest alone once every year , not without blood , which he offered for himself , and for the errors of the people : ",b.HEB.9.7,εἰς δὲ τὴν δευτέραν ἅπαξ τοῦ ἐνιαυτοῦ μόνος ὁ ἀρχιερεύς οὐ χωρὶς αἵματος ὃ προσφέρει ὑπὲρ ἑαυτοῦ καὶ τῶν τοῦ λαοῦ ἀγνοημάτων 
b.HEB.9.8,"The Holy Ghost this signifying , that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest , while as the first tabernacle was yet standing : ",b.HEB.9.8,τοῦτο δηλοῦντος τοῦ πνεύματος τοῦ ἁγίου μήπω πεφανερῶσθαι τὴν τῶν ἁγίων ὁδὸν ἔτι τῆς πρώτης σκηνῆς ἐχούσης στάσιν 
b.HEB.9.9,"Which was a figure for the time then present , in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices , that could not make him that did the service perfect , as pertaining to the conscience ; ",b.HEB.9.9,ἥτις παραβολὴ εἰς τὸν καιρὸν τὸν ἐνεστηκότα καθ ’ ἣν δῶρά τε καὶ θυσίαι προσφέρονται μὴ δυνάμεναι κατὰ συνείδησιν τελειῶσαι τὸν λατρεύοντα 
b.HEB.9.10,"Which stood only in meats and drinks , and divers washings , and carnal ordinances , imposed on them until the time of reformation . ",b.HEB.9.10,μόνον ἐπὶ βρώμασιν καὶ πόμασιν καὶ διαφόροις βαπτισμοῖς δικαιώματα σαρκὸς μέχρι καιροῦ διορθώσεως ἐπικείμενα 
b.HEB.9.11,"But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come , by a greater and more perfect tabernacle , not made with hands , that is to say , not of this building ; ",b.HEB.9.11,Χριστὸς δὲ παραγενόμενος ἀρχιερεὺς τῶν μελλόντων ἀγαθῶν διὰ τῆς μείζονος καὶ τελειοτέρας σκηνῆς οὐ χειροποιήτου τοῦτ ’ ἔστιν οὐ ταύτης τῆς κτίσεως 
b.HEB.9.12,"Neither by the blood of goats and calves , but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place , having obtained eternal redemption for us . ",b.HEB.9.12,οὐδὲ δι ’ αἵματος τράγων καὶ μόσχων διὰ δὲ τοῦ ἰδίου αἵματος εἰσῆλθεν ἐφάπαξ εἰς τὰ ἅγια αἰωνίαν λύτρωσιν εὑράμενος 
b.HEB.9.13,"For if the blood of bulls and of goats , and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean , sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh : ",b.HEB.9.13,εἰ γὰρ τὸ αἷμα τράγων καὶ ταύρων καὶ σποδὸς δαμάλεως ῥαντίζουσα τοὺς κεκοινωμένους ἁγιάζει πρὸς τὴν τῆς σαρκὸς καθαρότητα 
b.HEB.9.14,"How much more shall the blood of Christ , who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God , purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God ? ",b.HEB.9.14,πόσῳ μᾶλλον τὸ αἷμα τοῦ Χριστοῦ ὃς διὰ πνεύματος αἰωνίου ἑαυτὸν προσήνεγκεν ἄμωμον τῷ θεῷ καθαριεῖ τὴν συνείδησιν ὑμῶν ἀπὸ νεκρῶν ἔργων εἰς τὸ λατρεύειν θεῷ ζῶντι 
b.HEB.9.15,"And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament , that by means of death , for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament , they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance . ",b.HEB.9.15,Καὶ διὰ τοῦτο διαθήκης καινῆς μεσίτης ἐστίν ὅπως θανάτου γενομένου εἰς ἀπολύτρωσιν τῶν ἐπὶ τῇ πρώτῃ διαθήκῃ παραβάσεων τὴν ἐπαγγελίαν λάβωσιν οἱ κεκλημένοι τῆς αἰωνίου κληρονομίας 
b.HEB.9.16,"For where a testament is , there must also of necessity be the death of the testator . ",b.HEB.9.16,ὅπου γὰρ διαθήκη θάνατον ἀνάγκη φέρεσθαι τοῦ διαθεμένου 
b.HEB.9.17,For a testament is of force after men are dead : otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth . ,b.HEB.9.17,διαθήκη γὰρ ἐπὶ νεκροῖς βεβαία ἐπεὶ μήποτε ἰσχύει ὅτε ζῇ ὁ διαθέμενος 
b.HEB.9.18,Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood . ,b.HEB.9.18,ὅθεν οὐδ ’ ἡ πρώτη χωρὶς αἵματος ἐνκεκαίνισται 
b.HEB.9.19,"For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law , he took the blood of calves and of goats , with water , and scarlet wool , and hyssop , and sprinkled both the book , and all the people , ",b.HEB.9.19,λαληθείσης γὰρ πάσης ἐντολῆς κατὰ νόμον ὑπὸ Μωϋσέως παντὶ τῷ λαῷ λαβὼν τὸ αἷμα τῶν μόσχων καὶ τῶν τράγων μετὰ ὕδατος καὶ ἐρίου κοκκίνου καὶ ὑσσώπου αὐτό τε τὸ βιβλίον καὶ πάντα τὸν λαὸν ἐράντισεν 
b.HEB.9.20,"Saying , This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you . ",b.HEB.9.20,λέγων τοῦτο τὸ αἷμα τῆς διαθήκης ἧς ἐνετείλατο πρὸς ὑμᾶς ὁ θεός 
b.HEB.9.21,"Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle , and all the vessels of the ministry . ",b.HEB.9.21,καὶ τὴν σκηνὴν δὲ καὶ πάντα τὰ σκεύη τῆς λειτουργίας τῷ αἵματι ὁμοίως ἐράντισεν 
b.HEB.9.22,And almost all things are by the law purged with blood ; and without shedding of blood is no remission . ,b.HEB.9.22,καὶ σχεδὸν ἐν αἵματι πάντα καθαρίζεται κατὰ τὸν νόμον καὶ χωρὶς αἱματεκχυσίας οὐ γίνεται ἄφεσις 
b.HEB.9.23,It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these ; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these . ,b.HEB.9.23,ἀνάγκη οὖν τὰ μὲν ὑποδείγματα τῶν ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς τούτοις καθαρίζεσθαι αὐτὰ δὲ τὰ ἐπουράνια κρείττοσιν θυσίαις παρὰ ταύτας 
b.HEB.9.24,"For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands , which are the figures of the true ; but into heaven itself , now to appear in the presence of God for us : ",b.HEB.9.24,οὐ γὰρ εἰς χειροποίητα εἰσῆλθεν ἅγια Χριστός ἀντίτυπα τῶν ἀληθινῶν ἀλλ ’ εἰς αὐτὸν τὸν οὐρανόν νῦν ἐμφανισθῆναι τῷ προσώπῳ τοῦ θεοῦ ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν 
b.HEB.9.25,"Nor yet that he should offer himself often , as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others ; ",b.HEB.9.25,οὐδ ’ ἵνα πολλάκις προσφέρῃ ἑαυτόν ὥσπερ ὁ ἀρχιερεὺς εἰσέρχεται εἰς τὰ ἅγια κατ ’ ἐνιαυτὸν ἐν αἵματι ἀλλοτρίῳ 
b.HEB.9.26,For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world : but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself . ,b.HEB.9.26,ἐπεὶ ἔδει αὐτὸν πολλάκις παθεῖν ἀπὸ καταβολῆς κόσμου ,b.HEB.9.26,For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world : but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself . ,b.HEB.9.26,νυνὶ δὲ ἅπαξ ἐπὶ συντελείᾳ τῶν αἰώνων εἰς ἀθέτησιν ἁμαρτίας διὰ τῆς θυσίας αὐτοῦ πεφανέρωται 
b.HEB.9.26,For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world : but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself . ,b.HEB.9.26,ἐπεὶ ἔδει αὐτὸν πολλάκις παθεῖν ἀπὸ καταβολῆς κόσμου ,b.HEB.9.26,For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world : but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself . ,b.HEB.9.26,νυνὶ δὲ ἅπαξ ἐπὶ συντελείᾳ τῶν αἰώνων εἰς ἀθέτησιν ἁμαρτίας διὰ τῆς θυσίας αὐτοῦ πεφανέρωται 
b.HEB.9.27,"And as it is appointed unto men once to die , but after this the judgment : ",b.HEB.9.27,καὶ καθ ’ ὅσον ἀπόκειται τοῖς ἀνθρώποις ἅπαξ ἀποθανεῖν μετὰ δὲ τοῦτο κρίσις 
b.HEB.9.28,So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many ; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation . ,b.HEB.9.28,οὕτως καὶ ὁ Χριστός ἅπαξ προσενεχθεὶς εἰς τὸ πολλῶν ἀνενεγκεῖν ἁμαρτίας ἐκ δευτέρου χωρὶς ἁμαρτίας ὀφθήσεται τοῖς αὐτὸν ἀπεκδεχομένοις εἰς σωτηρίαν 
b.HEB.10.1,"For the law having a shadow of good things to come , and not the very image of the things , can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect . ",b.HEB.10.1,Σκιὰν γὰρ ἔχων ὁ νόμος τῶν μελλόντων ἀγαθῶν οὐκ αὐτὴν τὴν εἰκόνα τῶν πραγμάτων κατ ’ ἐνιαυτὸν ταῖς αὐταῖς θυσίαις αἷς προσφέρουσιν εἰς τὸ διηνεκὲς οὐδέποτε δύναται τοὺς προσερχομένους τελειῶσαι 
b.HEB.10.2,For then would they not have ceased to be offered ? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins . ,b.HEB.10.2,ἐπεὶ οὐκ ἂν ἐπαύσαντο προσφερόμεναι διὰ τὸ μηδεμίαν ἔχειν ἔτι συνείδησιν ἁμαρτιῶν τοὺς λατρεύοντας ἅπαξ κεκαθαρισμένους 
b.HEB.10.3,But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year . ,b.HEB.10.3,ἀλλ ’ ἐν αὐταῖς ἀνάμνησις ἁμαρτιῶν κατ ’ ἐνιαυτόν 
b.HEB.10.4,For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins . ,b.HEB.10.4,ἀδύνατον γὰρ αἷμα ταύρων καὶ τράγων ἀφαιρεῖν ἁμαρτίας 
b.HEB.10.5,"Wherefore when he cometh into the world , he saith , Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not , but a body hast thou prepared me : ",b.HEB.10.5,διὸ εἰσερχόμενος εἰς τὸν κόσμον λέγει θυσίαν καὶ προσφορὰν οὐκ ἠθέλησας σῶμα δὲ κατηρτίσω μοι 
b.HEB.10.6,In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure . ,b.HEB.10.6,ὁλοκαυτώματα καὶ περὶ ἁμαρτίας οὐκ ηὐδόκησας 
b.HEB.10.7,"Then said I , Lo , I come ( in the volume of the book it is written of me , ) to do thy will , O God . ",b.HEB.10.7,τότε εἶπον ἰδοὺ ἥκω ἐν κεφαλίδι βιβλίου γέγραπται περὶ ἐμοῦ τοῦ ποιῆσαι ὁ θεός τὸ θέλημά σου 
b.HEB.10.8,"Above when he said , Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not , neither hadst pleasure therein ; which are offered by the law ; ",b.HEB.10.8,ἀνώτερον λέγων ὅτι θυσίας καὶ προσφορὰς καὶ ὁλοκαυτώματα καὶ περὶ ἁμαρτίας οὐκ ἠθέλησας οὐδὲ ηὐδόκησας αἵτινες κατὰ νόμον προσφέρονται 
b.HEB.10.9,"Then said he , Lo , I come to do thy will , O God . He taketh away the first , that he may establish the second . ",b.HEB.10.9,τότε εἴρηκεν ἰδοὺ ἥκω τοῦ ποιῆσαι τὸ θέλημά σου ἀναιρεῖ τὸ πρῶτον ἵνα τὸ δεύτερον στήσῃ 
b.HEB.10.10,By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all . ,b.HEB.10.10,ἐν ᾧ θελήματι ἡγιασμένοι ἐσμὲν διὰ τῆς προσφορᾶς τοῦ σώματος Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ ἐφάπαξ 
b.HEB.10.11,"And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices , which can never take away sins : ",b.HEB.10.11,Καὶ πᾶς μὲν ἱερεὺς ἕστηκεν καθ ’ ἡμέραν λειτουργῶν καὶ τὰς αὐτὰς πολλάκις προσφέρων θυσίας αἵτινες οὐδέποτε δύνανται περιελεῖν ἁμαρτίας 
b.HEB.10.12,"But this man , after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever , sat down on the right hand of God ; ",b.HEB.10.12,οὗτος δὲ μίαν ὑπὲρ ἁμαρτιῶν προσενέγκας θυσίαν εἰς τὸ διηνεκὲς ἐκάθισεν ἐν δεξιᾷ τοῦ θεοῦ 
b.HEB.10.13,From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool . ,b.HEB.10.13,τὸ λοιπὸν ἐκδεχόμενος ἕως τεθῶσιν οἱ ἐχθροὶ αὐτοῦ ὑποπόδιον τῶν ποδῶν αὐτοῦ 
b.HEB.10.14,For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified . ,b.HEB.10.14,μιᾷ γὰρ προσφορᾷ τετελείωκεν εἰς τὸ διηνεκὲς τοὺς ἁγιαζομένους 
b.HEB.10.15,"Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us : for after that he had said before , ",b.HEB.10.15,μαρτυρεῖ δὲ ἡμῖν καὶ τὸ πνεῦμα τὸ ἅγιον μετὰ γὰρ τὸ εἰρηκέναι 
b.HEB.10.16,"This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days , saith the Lord , I will put my laws into their hearts , and in their minds will I write them ; ",b.HEB.10.16,αὕτη ἡ διαθήκη ἣν διαθήσομαι πρὸς αὐτοὺς μετὰ τὰς ἡμέρας ἐκείνας ,b.HEB.10.16,"This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days , saith the Lord , I will put my laws into their hearts , and in their minds will I write them ; ",b.HEB.10.16,λέγει κύριος διδοὺς νόμους μου ἐπὶ καρδίας αὐτῶν καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν διάνοιαν αὐτῶν ἐπιγράψω αὐτούς
