b.HEB.8.8,"For finding fault with them , he saith , Behold , the days come , saith the Lord , when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah : ",b.HEB.8.8,"Dios paigunahua piñarisha nica : Punzhauna shamunaungami , Señor nin , imahoras shu mushuj pactachina shimira alichishami Israelba huasihua Judá huasihuas .

b.HEB.9.8,"The Holy Ghost this signifying , that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest , while as the first tabernacle was yet standing : ",b.HEB.9.8,Santo Espíritu caimanda yachachin imasna Santísimo Lugar nishca ucu partima chara mana icuihuajchu aca ñaupa tabernáculo chara shayaullaira . 
b.HEB.9.9,"Which was a figure for the time then present , in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices , that could not make him that did the service perfect , as pertaining to the conscience ; ",b.HEB.9.9,"Cai tabernáculo shu cuna horasgama ricuchina cuentami , chihui cuyashcaunara sacrificiounaras ricuchinaunmi , shinajllaira caiguna shina raj runara alichinara mana ushanaunzhu paihua alirana iyaibi .

b.HEB.9.11,"But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come , by a greater and more perfect tabernacle , not made with hands , that is to say , not of this building ; ",b.HEB.9.11,"Astaumbas Cristo ña shamushcami , shamuj bendiciongunara cuj sacerdote atun apu .

b.HEB.9.12,"Neither by the blood of goats and calves , but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place , having obtained eternal redemption for us .

b.HEB.9.13,"For if the blood of bulls and of goats , and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean , sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh : ",b.HEB.9.13,"Huagra yahuar , cari chivo yahuar , malta huarmi huagra ushpas , irus runauna ahuai chausishca asha chicanyachisha aichara pichangaj , "
b.HEB.9.14,"How much more shall the blood of Christ , who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God , purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God ?

b.HEB.9.15,"And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament , that by means of death , for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament , they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance .

b.HEB.9.16,"For where a testament is , there must also of necessity be the death of the testator . ",b.HEB.9.16,"Testamento nishca pactachina quillca tiajpi , dueño huañuna anga chi quillca valij tucuncaj . "
b.HEB.9.17,For a testament is of force after men are dead : otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth . ,b.HEB.9.17,"Testamento quillcaga dueño huañushca huasha valinmi , astaun mana valinzhu dueño chara causaullaira . "
b.HEB.9.18,Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood . ,b.HEB.9.18,Chiraigumanda ñaupa pactachina shimis mana yahuar illaj cushcachu aca . 
b.HEB.9.19,"For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law , he took the blood of calves and of goats , with water , and scarlet wool , and hyssop , and sprinkled both the book , and all the people , ",b.HEB.9.19,"Moisesga tucui mandashca shimiunara tucui runaunama rimashca huasha , huagra yahuarda cari chivo yahuardas apisha , yacuhua , puca illmahua , chausina pangaunahuas , quiquin quillcara shinallara tucui runaunaras chausica , "

b.HEB.9.22,And almost all things are by the law purged with blood ; and without shedding of blood is no remission . ,b.HEB.9.22,"Ley shimii ñaca tucuira yahuarhua pichashcami . Yahuar mana talirijpi , uchara mana perdonashcachu . "
b.HEB.9.23,It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these ; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these . ,b.HEB.9.23,"Ministiricami ahua pachai tiaj ricuchijgunara casna sacrificiounahua pichai tucungaj , astaun quiquin ahua pachai tiajgunaga yali valij sacrificiounara ministinauca .

b.HEB.9.24,"For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands , which are the figures of the true ; but into heaven itself , now to appear in the presence of God for us : ",b.HEB.9.24,"Cristoga mana icucachu maquihua rashca Diosta alabana huasii , chiga cierto aj huasimanda ricuchijlla aca , astaumbas quiquin ahua pachai icuca , paulara ñucanchimanda Diospa ñaupajpi cuna ricuchingaj .

b.HEB.9.25,"Nor yet that he should offer himself often , as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others ; ",b.HEB.9.25,"Maspas , mana ashca cuti paulara cungaj icucachu , imasna caran huatai sacerdote atun apu Santísimo Lugarbi icun shujpa yahuarhua . "
b.HEB.9.26,For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world : but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself . ,b.HEB.9.26,"Mana shina ajpi ministirinmaca Cristo ashca cuti tormendarina , mundu callarinamanda pacha ; astaun cunaga tiempouna pactariushcai , paillarara shu cutilla cuca huiñaigama , pai quiquinllarara sacrificiora cuenta cungaj uchara quichungaj .

b.HEB.9.28,So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many ; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation . ,b.HEB.9.28,"shinallarami Cristo shu cutilla cushca aca ashcauna ucharashcaunamanda . Chihuasha cutillara ricuringami , mana ucharaigumanda , astaun paita chapaugunara quishpichingaj . "
b.HEB.10.1,"For the law having a shadow of good things to come , and not the very image of the things , can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect . ",b.HEB.10.1,"Ley mandashca shimiga shamuj bendicionguna almallara charin , astaun paiguna quiquin ricurinara mana charinzhu . Chiraigumanda cai ley shimi caran huatai cuti rashca sacrificiounahua shamujgunara mana imahoraspas alichinara ushanzhu . "
b.HEB.10.2,For then would they not have ceased to be offered ? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins . ,b.HEB.10.2,"Mana shina ajpiga cai sacrificiounara cungaj ña tucurinmaca , casna rasha alabajguna shu cuti pichashca asha , ucha iyaira ña mana charinaunmaca .

b.HEB.10.4,For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins . ,b.HEB.10.4,cari huagra cari chivo yahuarga ucharashcaunara quichunara mana ushashcaraigumanda . 
b.HEB.10.5,"Wherefore when he cometh into the world , he saith , Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not , but a body hast thou prepared me : ",b.HEB.10.5,"Chiraigumanda pai mundui icusha , nin : Sacrificioras cuyashcaras mana munacangui , randi aichara ñucajta alichishcangui . "
