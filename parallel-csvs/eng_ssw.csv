b.ROM.5.14,"Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses , even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam ' s transgression , who is the figure of him that was to come .

b.ROM.5.15,"But not as the offence , so also is the free gift . For if through the offence of one many be dead , much more the grace of God , and the gift by grace , which is by one man , Jesus Christ , hath abounded unto many .

Maana , ingawa dhambi ya mtu mmoja ilisababisha kifo kwa wote , kwa fadhili ya mtu mmoja , yaani Yesu Kristo , Mungu amewazidishia wote neema na zawadi zake . "
b.ROM.5.16,"And not as it was by one that sinned , so is the gift : for the judgment was by one to condemnation , but the free gift is of many offences unto justification .

b.ROM.5.17,"For if by one man ' s offence death reigned by one ; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one , Jesus Christ . ) ",b.ROM.5.17,"Kweli , kwa dhambi ya mtu mmoja kifo kilianza kutawala kwa sababu ya huyo mtu mmoja ; lakini , ni dhahiri zaidi kwamba alichokifanya yule mtu mmoja , yaani Yesu Kristo , ni bora zaidi .

b.ROM.5.18,Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation ; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life . ,b.ROM.5.18,"Basi , kama vile kosa la mtu mmoja lilivyoleta hukumu kwa binadamu wote , kadhalika kitendo kimoja kiadilifu kinawapa uhuru na uzima .

b.ROM.5.19,"For as by one man ' s disobedience many were made sinners , so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous . ",b.ROM.5.19,"Na kama kwa kutotii kwa mtu mmoja watu wengi walifanywa wenye dhambi , kadhalika kutii kwa mtu mmoja kutawafanya wengi wakubaliwe kuwa waadilifu . "
b.ROM.5.20,"Moreover the law entered , that the offence might abound . But where sin abounded , grace did much more abound : ",b.ROM.5.20,"Sheria ilitokea , ikasababisha kuongezeka kwa uhalifu ; lakini pale dhambi ilipoongezeka , neema iliongezeka zaidi . "
b.ROM.5.21,"That as sin hath reigned unto death , even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord .

b.ROM.6.8,"Now if we be dead with Christ , we believe that we shall also live with him : ",b.ROM.6.8,"Basi , ikiwa tumekufa pamoja na Kristo , tunaamini kwamba tutaishi pia pamoja naye . "
b.ROM.6.9,Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more ; death hath no more dominion over him . ,b.ROM.6.9,"Maana , tunajua kwamba Kristo amekwisha fufuliwa kutoka wafu na hafi tena ; kifo hakimtawali tena . "
b.ROM.6.10,"For in that he died , he died unto sin once : but in that he liveth , he liveth unto God . ",b.ROM.6.10,"Hivyo , kwa kuwa alikufa - - mara moja tu - - dhambi haina nguvu tena juu yake ; na sasa anaishi maisha yake katika umoja na Mungu . "

b.ROM.6.14,"For sin shall not have dominion over you : for ye are not under the law , but under grace . ",b.ROM.6.14,"Maana , dhambi haitawatawala ninyi tena , kwani hamko chini ya Sheria , bali chini ya neema . "

b.ROM.7.5,"For when we were in the flesh , the motions of sins , which were by the law , did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death .

b.GAL.2.13,And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him ; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation . ,b.GAL.2.13,"Hata ndugu wengine Wayahudi walimuunga mkono Petro katika kitendo hiki cha unafiki , naye Barnaba akakumbwa na huo unafiki wao . "
b.GAL.2.14,"But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel , I said unto Peter before them all , If thou , being a Jew , livest after the manner of Gentiles , and not as do the Jews , why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews ?

b.GAL.2.15,"We who are Jews by nature , and not sinners of the Gentiles , ",b.GAL.2.15,"Kweli , sisi kwa asili ni Wayahudi , na si watu wa mataifa mengine hao wenye dhambi ! "

b.GAL.2.17,"But if , while we seek to be justified by Christ , we ourselves also are found sinners , is therefore Christ the minister of sin ? God forbid .

b.GAL.2.18,"For if I build again the things which I destroyed , I make myself a transgressor . ",b.GAL.2.18,"Lakini ikiwa ninajenga tena kile nilichokwisha bomoa , basi nahakikisha kwamba mimi ni mhalifu . "
b.GAL.2.19,"For I through the law am dead to the law , that I might live unto God . ",b.GAL.2.19,"Maana , kuhusu Sheria hiyo , mimi nimekufa ; Sheria yenyewe iliniua , nipate kuishi kwa ajili ya Mungu . Mimi nimeuawa pamoja na Kristo msalabani , "

b.GAL.3.16,"Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made . He saith not , And to seeds , as of many ; but as of one , And to thy seed , which is Christ .

b.GAL.3.18,"For if the inheritance be of the law , it is no more of promise : but God gave it to Abraham by promise . ",b.GAL.3.18,"Maana , kama urithi ya Mungu inategemea Sheria , basi , haiwezi kutegemea tena ahadi ya Mungu . Kumbe , lakini Mungu alimkirimia Abrahamu kwa sababu aliahidi . "

b.HEB.4.11,"Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest , lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief . ",b.HEB.4.11,"Basi , tujitahidi kupata pumziko hilo , ili asiwepo yeyote miongoni mwenu atakayeshindwa , kama walivyofanya wao kwa sababu ya ukosefu wao wa imani . "
b.HEB.4.12,"For the word of God is quick , and powerful , and sharper than any twoedged sword , piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit , and of the joints and marrow , and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart . ",b.HEB.4.12,"Neno la Mungu ni hai na lina nguvu ; ni kali zaidi kuliko upanga wenye makali kuwili . Hukata kabisa mpaka mahali ambapo moyo na roho hukutana , mpaka pale vikutanapo viungo vya mwili na mafuta . Neno hilo huchambua nia na fikira za mioyo ya watu . "
b.HEB.4.13,Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight : but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do . ,b.HEB.4.13,"Hakuna kiumbe chochote kilichofichika mbele ya Mungu ; kila kitu kimefunuliwa wazi mbele ya macho yake . Kwake , sisi sote tutapaswa kutoa hoja ya matendo yetu . "
b.HEB.4.14,"Seeing then that we have a great high priest , that is passed into the heavens , Jesus the Son of God , let us hold fast our profession . ",b.HEB.4.14,"Basi , tunapaswa kuzingatia kwa uthabiti imani tunayoiungama . Maana tunaye Kuhani Mkuu aliyeingia mpaka kwa Mungu mwenyewe - - Yesu , Mwana wa Mungu . "
b.HEB.4.15,"For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities ; but was in all points tempted like as we are , yet without sin . ",b.HEB.4.15,"Huyu Kuhani Mkuu wetu si mmoja ambaye hawezi kutuunga mkono katika unyonge wetu , ila ni Kuhani Mkuu ambaye alijaribiwa kama sisi kwa kila namna lakini hakutenda dhambi . "
b.HEB.4.16,"Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace , that we may obtain mercy , and find grace to help in time of need . ",b.HEB.4.16,"Basi , na tukikaribie bila hofu kiti cha enzi cha Mungu , palipo na neema , ili tukajipatie huruma na neema ya kutusaidia wakati wa lazima . "
b.HEB.5.1,"For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God , that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins : ",b.HEB.5.1,"Kila kuhani mkuu huchaguliwa kutoka miongoni mwa watu kwa ajili ya kumtumikia Mungu kwa niaba yao , kutolea zawadi na tambiko kwa ajili ya dhambi zao .

b.HEB.5.2,"Who can have compassion on the ignorant , and on them that are out of the way ; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity . ",b.HEB.5.2,Maadamu yeye mwenyewe yu dhaifu anaweza kuwaonea huruma wale wasiojua kitu na wanaofanya makosa . 
b.HEB.5.3,"And by reason hereof he ought , as for the people , so also for himself , to offer for sins . ",b.HEB.5.3,"Na kwa vile yeye mwenyewe ni dhaifu , anapaswa kutolea dhabihu si tu kwa ajili ya watu , bali pia kwa ajili ya dhambi zake . "
b.HEB.5.4,"And no man taketh this honour unto himself , but he that is called of God , as was Aaron . ",b.HEB.5.4,Hakuna mtu awezaye kujitwalia mwenyewe heshima ya kuwa kuhani mkuu . Kila mmoja huteuliwa na Mungu kuwa kuhani mkuu kama alivyokuwa Aroni . 
b.HEB.5.5,"So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest ; but he that said unto him , Thou art my Son , to day have I begotten thee . ",b.HEB.5.5,"Hali kadhalika naye Kristo hakujitwalia mwenyewe heshima ya kuwa kuhani mkuu , bali Mungu alimwambia : "" Wewe ni Mwanangu ; mimi leo nimekuwa baba yako . "" "
b.HEB.5.6,"As he saith also in another place , Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec . ",b.HEB.5.6,"Alisema pia mahali pengine : "" Wewe ni kuhani milele , kufuatana na utaratibu wa ukuhani wa Melkisedeki . "" "
b.HEB.5.7,"Who in the days of his flesh , when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death , and was heard in that he feared ; ",b.HEB.5.7,"Yesu alipokuwa anaishi hapa duniani , kwa kilio kikuu na machozi , alisali na kumwomba Mungu ambaye alikuwa na uwezo wa kumwokoa kutoka kifo ; naye alisikilizwa kwa sababu ya kumcha Mungu .

b.HEB.5.8,"Though he were a Son , yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered ; ",b.HEB.5.8,"Lakini , ingawa alikuwa Mwana wa Mungu , alijifunza kutii kwa njia ya mateso . "
b.HEB.5.9,"And being made perfect , he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him ; ",b.HEB.5.9,"Na alipofanywa mkamilifu , akawa chanzo cha wokovu wa milele kwa wale wote wanaomtii , "
b.HEB.5.10,Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec . ,b.HEB.5.10,naye Mungu akamteua kuwa kuhani mkuu kufuatana na utaratibu wa ukuhani wa Melkisedeki . 
b.HEB.5.11,"Of whom we have many things to say , and hard to be uttered , seeing ye are dull of hearing . ",b.HEB.5.11,"Tunayo Mengi ya kusema juu ya jambo hili , lakini ni vigumu kuwaelezeni , kwa sababu ninyi si wepesi wa kuelewa . "
b.HEB.5.12,"For when for the time ye ought to be teachers , ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God ; and are become such as have need of milk , and not of strong meat . ",b.HEB.5.12,"Sasa mngalipaswa kuwa tayari walimu , lakini mnahitaji bado mtu wa kuwafundisheni mafundisho ya mwanzo ya ujumbe wa Mungu . Badala ya kula chakula kigumu , mnapaswa bado kunywa maziwa .

b.HEB.5.13,For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness : for he is a babe . ,b.HEB.5.13,"Kila anayepaswa kunywa maziwa huyo ni mtoto bado , hajui uadilifu ni nini . "
b.HEB.5.14,"But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age , even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil . ",b.HEB.5.14,"Lakini chakula kigumu ni kwa ajili ya watu waliokomaa , ambao wanaweza kubainisha mema na mabaya . "
b.HEB.6.1,"Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ , let us go on unto perfection ; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works , and of faith toward God , ",b.HEB.6.1,"Basi , tusonge mbele kwa yale yaliyokomaa na kuyaacha nyuma yale mafundisho ya mwanzo ya Kikristo .

b.HEB.6.2,"Of the doctrine of baptisms , and of laying on of hands , and of resurrection of the dead , and of eternal judgment . ",b.HEB.6.2,mafundisho juu ya ubatizo na kuwekewa mikono ; ufufuo wa wafu na hukumu ya milele . 
b.HEB.6.3,"And this will we do , if God permit . ",b.HEB.6.3,"tusonge mbele ! Hayo tutayafanya , Mungu akitujalia . "
b.HEB.6.4,"For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened , and have tasted of the heavenly gift , and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost , ",b.HEB.6.4,"Maana watu wanaoiasi imani yao inawezekanaje kuwarudisha watubu tena ?

b.HEB.6.5,"And have tasted the good word of God , and the powers of the world to come , ",b.HEB.6.5,"walikwisha onja wema wa neno la Mungu na nguvu za ulimwengu ujao , "
b.HEB.6.6,"If they shall fall away , to renew them again unto repentance ; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh , and put him to an open shame .

b.HEB.6.7,"For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it , and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed , receiveth blessing from God : ",b.HEB.6.7,"Mungu huibariki ardhi ambayo huipokea mvua inayoinyeshea mara kwa mara , na kuotesha mimea ya faida kwa mkulima .

b.HEB.6.8,"But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected , and is nigh unto cursing ; whose end is to be burned . ",b.HEB.6.8,"Lakini kama ardhi hiyo ikiota miti ya miiba na magugu , haina faida ; karibu italaaniwa na Mungu na mwisho wake ni kuchomwa moto . "

b.HEB.6.10,"For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love , which ye have shewed toward his name , in that ye have ministered to the saints , and do minister .

b.HEB.6.11,And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end : ,b.HEB.6.11,"Hamu yetu ni kwamba kila mmoja wenu aonyeshe bidii hiyohiyo mpaka mwisho , ili yale mnayotumainia yapate kutimia . "
b.HEB.6.12,"That ye be not slothful , but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises . ",b.HEB.6.12,"Msiwe wavivu , bali muwe kama wale wanaoamini na wenye uvumilivu na hivyo wanapokea yake aliyoahidi Mungu . "
b.HEB.6.13,"For when God made promise to Abraham , because he could swear by no greater , he sware by himself , ",b.HEB.6.13,"Mungu alipompa Abrahamu ahadi , aliapa kwa jina lake mwenyewe , maana hakuna aliye mkuu kuliko Mungu ambaye kwa huyo angeweza kuapa . "
b.HEB.6.14,"Saying , Surely blessing I will bless thee , and multiplying I will multiply thee . ",b.HEB.6.14,"Mungu alisema : "" Hakika nitakubariki na nitakupa wazawa wengi . "" "
b.HEB.6.15,"And so , after he had patiently endured , he obtained the promise . ",b.HEB.6.15,Abrahamu alisubiri kwa uvumilivu na hivyo alipokea kile alichoahidiwa na Mungu . 
b.HEB.6.16,For men verily swear by the greater : and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife . ,b.HEB.6.16,"Watu wanapoapa , huapa kwa mmoja aliye mkuu zaidi kuliko wao , na kiapo hicho husuluhisha ubishi wote . "
b.HEB.6.17,"Wherein God , willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel , confirmed it by an oath : ",b.HEB.6.17,Naye Mungu aliimarisha ahadi yake kwa kiapo ; na kwa namna hiyo akawaonyesha wazi wale aliowaahidia kwamba hatabadili nia yake . 
b.HEB.6.18,"That by two immutable things , in which it was impossible for God to lie , we might have a strong consolation , who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us : ",b.HEB.6.18,"Basi , kuna vitu hivi viwili : ahadi na kiapo , ambavyo haviwezi kubadilika na wala juu ya hivyo Mungu hawezi kusema uongo .

b.HEB.6.19,"Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul , both sure and stedfast , and which entereth into that within the veil ; ",b.HEB.6.19,"Tunalo tumaini hilo kama nanga ya maisha yetu . Tumaini hilo ni imara na thabiti , nalo lapenya lile pazia la hekalu la mbinguni mpaka patakatifu ndani . "
b.HEB.6.20,"Whither the forerunner is for us entered , even Jesus , made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec . ",b.HEB.6.20,"Yesu ametangulia kuingia humo kwa niaba yetu , na amekuwa kuhani mkuu milele , kufuatana na utaratibu wa ukuhani wa Melkisedeki . "
b.HEB.7.1,"For this Melchisedec , king of Salem , priest of the most high God , who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings , and blessed him ; ",b.HEB.7.1,"Melkisedeki alikuwa mfalme wa Salemu , na kuhani wa Mungu Mkuu . Abrahamu alipokuwa anarudi kutoka vitani ambako aliwaua wafalme , Melkisedeki alikutana naye akambariki , "
b.HEB.7.2,"To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all ; first being by interpretation King of righteousness , and after that also King of Salem , which is , King of peace ; ",b.HEB.7.2,"naye Abrahamu akampa sehemu ya kumi ya vitu vyote alivyokuwa navyo . ( Maana ya kwanza ya jina hili Melkisedeki ni "" Mfalme wa Uadilifu "" ; na , kwa vile yeye alikuwa mfalme wa Salemu , jina lake pia lina maana ya "" Mfalme wa Amani . "" ) "
b.HEB.7.3,"Without father , without mother , without descent , having neither beginning of days , nor end of life ; but made like unto the Son of God ; abideth a priest continually . ",b.HEB.7.3,"Baba yake na mama yake hawatajwi , wala ukoo wake hautajwi ; haisemwi alizaliwa lini au alikufa lini . Anafanana na Mwana wa Mungu , na anaendelea kuwa kuhani daima . "
b.HEB.7.4,"Now consider how great this man was , unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils . ",b.HEB.7.4,"Basi , mwaona jinsi mtu huyu alivyokuwa maarufu . Baba Abrahamu alimpa sehemu moja ya kumi ya vitu vyote alivyoteka vitani . "
b.HEB.7.5,"And verily they that are of the sons of Levi , who receive the office of the priesthood , have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law , that is , of their brethren , though they come out of the loins of Abraham : ",b.HEB.7.5,"Tunajua vilevile kwamba kufuatana na Sheria , wana wa Lawi ambao ni makuhani , wanayo haki ya kuchukua sehemu ya kumi kutoka kwa watu , yaani ndugu zao , ingawaje nao ni watoto wa Abrahamu .

b.HEB.7.6,"But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham , and blessed him that had the promises . ",b.HEB.7.6,"Lakini huyo Melkisedeki hakuwa wa ukoo wa Lawi , hata hivyo alipokea sehemu ya kumi kutoka kwa Abrahamu ; tena akambariki yeye ambaye alikuwa amepewa ahadi ya Mungu . "
b.HEB.7.7,And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better . ,b.HEB.7.7,Hakuna mashaka hata kidogo kwamba anayebariki ni mkuu zaidi kuliko yule anayebarikiwa . 
b.HEB.7.8,"And here men that die receive tithes ; but there he receiveth them , of whom it is witnessed that he liveth . ",b.HEB.7.8,"Tena , hao makuhani wanaopokea sehemu ya kumi , ni watu ambao hufa ; lakini hapa anayepokea sehemu ya kumi , yaani Melkisedeki , anasemekana kwamba hafi . "
b.HEB.7.9,"And as I may so say , Levi also , who receiveth tithes , payed tithes in Abraham . ",b.HEB.7.9,"Twaweza , basi , kusema kwamba Abrahamu alipotoa sehemu moja ya kumi , Lawi ( ambaye watoto wake hupokea sehemu moja ya kumi ) alitoa sehemu moja ya kumi pia . "
b.HEB.7.10,"For he was yet in the loins of his father , when Melchisedec met him . ",b.HEB.7.10,"Maana Lawi hakuwa amezaliwa bado , bali ni kama alikuwa katika mwili wa baba yake , Abrahamu , wakati Melkisedeki alipokutana naye . "
b.HEB.7.11,"If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood , ( for under it the people received the law , ) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec , and not be called after the order of Aaron ? ",b.HEB.7.11,"Kutokana na ukuhani wa Walawi , watu wa Israeli walipewa Sheria . Sasa , kama huduma ya Walawi ingalikuwa kamilifu hapangekuwa tena na haja ya kutokea ukuhani mwingine tofauti , ukuhani ambao umefuata utaratibu wa ukuhani wa Melkisedeki , na si ule wa Aroni . "
b.HEB.7.12,"For the priesthood being changed , there is made of necessity a change also of the law . ",b.HEB.7.12,Maana ukuhani ukibadilika ni lazima Sheria nayo ibadilike . 
b.HEB.7.13,"For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe , of which no man gave attendance at the altar . ",b.HEB.7.13,"Naye Bwana wetu ambaye mambo hayo yote yanasemwa juu yake , alikuwa wa kabila lingine , na wala hakuna hata mmoja wa kabila lake aliyepata kutumikia madhabahuni akiwa kuhani . "
b.HEB.7.14,For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda ; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood . ,b.HEB.7.14,Inafahamika wazi kwamba yeye alizaliwa katika kabila la Yuda ambalo Mose hakulitaja alipokuwa anasema juu ya makuhani . 
b.HEB.7.15,"And it is yet far more evident : for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest , ",b.HEB.7.15,Tena jambo hili ni dhahiri zaidi : kuhani mwingine anayefanana na Melkisedeki amekwisha tokea . 
b.HEB.7.16,"Who is made , not after the law of a carnal commandment , but after the power of an endless life . ",b.HEB.7.16,"Yeye hakufanywa kuwa kuhani kwa sheria na maagizo ya kibinadamu , bali kwa nguvu ya uhai ambao hauna mwisho . "
b.HEB.7.17,"For he testifieth , Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec . ",b.HEB.7.17,"Maana Maandiko yasema : "" Wewe ni kuhani milele , kufuatana na utaratibu wa ukuhani wa Melkisedeki . "" "
b.HEB.7.18,For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof . ,b.HEB.7.18,"Basi , ile amri ya zamani ilifutwa kwa sababu ilikuwa hafifu na isiyofaa kitu . "
b.HEB.7.19,"For the law made nothing perfect , but the bringing in of a better hope did ; by the which we draw nigh unto God . ",b.HEB.7.19,"Maana Sheria ya Mose haikuweza kukamilisha jambo lolote . Lakini sasa , mahali pake pamewekwa tumaini lililo bora zaidi ambalo kwalo tunaweza kumkaribia Mungu . "
b.HEB.7.20,And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest : ,b.HEB.7.20,Zaidi ya hayo hapa pana kiapo cha Mungu . Wakati wale wengine walipofanywa makuhani hapakuwako kiapo . 
b.HEB.7.21," ( For those priests were made without an oath ; but this with an oath by him that said unto him , The Lord sware and will not repent , Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec : ) ",b.HEB.7.21,"Lakini Yesu alifanywa kuhani kwa kiapo wakati Mungu alipomwambia : "" Bwana ameapa , wala hataigeuza nia yake : Wewe ni kuhani milele .

b.HEB.7.22,By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament . ,b.HEB.7.22,"Basi , kutokana na tofauti hii , Yesu amekuwa mdhamini wa agano lililo bora zaidi . "
b.HEB.7.23,"And they truly were many priests , because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death : ",b.HEB.7.23,Kuna tofauti nyingine pia : hao makuhani wengine walikuwa wengi kwa sababu walikufa na hawakuweza kuendelea na kazi yao . 
b.HEB.7.24,"But this man , because he continueth ever , hath an unchangeable priesthood . ",b.HEB.7.24,"Lakini Yesu si kama wao , yeye anaishi milele ; ukuhani wake hauondoki kwake . "
b.HEB.7.25,"Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him , seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them . ",b.HEB.7.25,"Hivyo , yeye anaweza daima kuwaokoa kabisa wote wanaomwendea Mungu kwa njia yake , maana yeye anaishi milele kuwaombea kwa Mungu . "
b.HEB.7.26,"For such an high priest became us , who is holy , harmless , undefiled , separate from sinners , and made higher than the heavens ; ",b.HEB.7.26,"Basi , Yesu ndiye Kuhani Mkuu ambaye anatufaa sana katika mahitaji yetu . Yeye ni mtakatifu , hana hatia wala dhambi ndani yake ; hayumo katika kundi la wenye dhambi na ameinuliwa mpaka juu mbinguni . "
b.HEB.7.27,"Who needeth not daily , as those high priests , to offer up sacrifice , first for his own sins , and then for the people ' s : for this he did once , when he offered up himself .

Yeye alifanya hivyo mara moja tu wakati alipojitoa yeye mwenyewe , na hiyo yatosha kwa nyakati zote . "
b.HEB.7.28,"For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity ; but the word of the oath , which was since the law , maketh the Son , who is consecrated for evermore . ",b.HEB.7.28,Sheria ya Mose huwateua watu waliokuwa dhaifu kuwa makuhani wakuu ; lakini ahadi ya Mungu aliyoifanya kwa kiapo na ambayo imefika baada ya sheria imemteua Mwana ambaye amefanywa mkamilifu milele . 
b.HEB.8.1,"Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum : We have such an high priest , who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens ; ",b.HEB.8.1,"Basi , jambo muhimu katika hayo tunayosema ni hili : sisi tunaye Kuhani Mkuu wa namna hiyo , ambaye anaketi upande wa kulia wa kiti cha enzi cha Mwenyezi Mungu mbinguni .

b.HEB.8.2,"A minister of the sanctuary , and of the true tabernacle , which the Lord pitched , and not man . ",b.HEB.8.2,"Yeye hutoa huduma ya Kuhani Mkuu katika Mahali Patakatifu sana , yaani ndani ya ile hema ya kweli iliyojengwa na Bwana , siyo na binadamu . "
b.HEB.8.3,For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices : wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer . ,b.HEB.8.3,"Kila Kuhani Mkuu ameteuliwa kumtolea Mungu vipawa na dhabihu , na hivyo Kuhani Mkuu wetu lazima pia awe na kitu cha kutolea . "
b.HEB.8.4,"For if he were on earth , he should not be a priest , seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law : ",b.HEB.8.4,"Kama yeye angekuwa wa hapa duninani , asingekuwa kamwe kuhani , kwani wako makuhani wengine wanaotoa sadaka kufuatana na Sheria . "
b.HEB.8.5,"Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things , as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle : for , See , saith he , that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount . ",b.HEB.8.5,"Huduma zao za kikuhani ni mfano tu na kivuli cha yale yaliyoko mbinguni . Ndivyo pia ilivyokuwa kwa Mose . Wakati alipokuwa karibu kuitengeneza ile hema , Mungu alimwambia : "" Tengeneza kila kitu kufuatana na ule mfano ulioonyeshwa kule mlimani . "" "
b.HEB.8.6,"But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry , by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant , which was established upon better promises . ",b.HEB.8.6,"Lakini sasa Yesu amepewa huduma ya kikuhani iliyo bora zaidi kuliko yao , kama vile agano alilothibitisha kati ya watu na Mungu ni bora zaidi , kwani lina msingi wake katika ahadi za mambo yaliyo bora zaidi .

b.HEB.8.7,"For if that first covenant had been faultless , then should no place have been sought for the second . ",b.HEB.8.7,"Maana kama lile agano la kwanza halingalikuwa na dosari , hakungalikuwa na haja ya agano la pili . "
b.HEB.8.8,"For finding fault with them , he saith , Behold , the days come , saith the Lord , when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah : ",b.HEB.8.8,"Lakini Mungu aliwalaumu watu wake aliposema : "" Siku zinakuja , asema Bwana , ambapo nitafanya agano jipya na watu wa Israeli na kabila la Yuda .

b.HEB.8.10,"For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days , saith the Lord ; I will put my laws into their mind , and write them in their hearts : and I will be to them a God , and they shall be to me a people : ",b.HEB.8.10,"Na hili ndilo agano nitakalofanya na watu wa Israeli siku zijazo , asema Bwana : Nitaweka sheria zangu akilini mwao , na kuziandika mioyoni mwao .

b.HEB.9.1,"Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service , and a worldly sanctuary . ",b.HEB.9.1,Agano la kwanza lilikuwa na taratibu zake za ibada na pia mahali patakatifu pa ibada palipojengwa na watu .

b.HEB.9.3,"And after the second veil , the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all ; ",b.HEB.9.3,"Nyuma ya pazia la pili , kulikuwa na hema iliyoitwa Mahali Patakatifu Kupita Pote . "
b.HEB.9.4,"Which had the golden censer , and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold , wherein was the golden pot that had manna , and Aaron ' s rod that budded , and the tables of the covenant ; ",b.HEB.9.4,"Humo mlikuwa na madhabahu ya dhahabu kwa ajili ya kufukizia ubani , na Sanduku la Agano , ambalo lilikuwa limepakwa dhahabu pande zote , na ndani yake mlikuwa na chungu cha dhahabu kilichokuwa na mana ; fimbo ya Aroni iliyokuwa imechanua majani , na vile vibao viwili vilivyoandikwa agano . "
b.HEB.9.5,And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat ; of which we cannot now speak particularly . ,b.HEB.9.5,"Juu ya hilo Sanduku kulikuwa na viumbe vilivyodhihirisha kuweko kwa Mungu , na mabawa yao yalitanda juu ya mahali ambapo dhambi huondolewa . Lakini sasa , hatuwezi kusema kinaganaga juu ya mambo hayo . "
b.HEB.9.6,"Now when these things were thus ordained , the priests went always into the first tabernacle , accomplishing the service of God . ",b.HEB.9.6,Mipango hiyo ilitekelezwa kisha ikawa desturi kwa makuhani kuingia kila siku katika hema ya nje kutoa huduma zao . 
b.HEB.9.7,"But into the second went the high priest alone once every year , not without blood , which he offered for himself , and for the errors of the people : ",b.HEB.9.7,Lakini kuhani Mkuu peke yake ndiye anayeingia katika lile hema la pili ; naye hufanya hivyo mara moja tu kwa mwaka . Anapoingia ndani huwa amechukua damu ambayo anamtolea Mungu kwa ajili yake mwenyewe na kwa ajili ya dhambi ambazo watu wamezitenda bila wao wenyewe kujua . 
b.HEB.9.8,"The Holy Ghost this signifying , that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest , while as the first tabernacle was yet standing : ",b.HEB.9.8,"Kutokana na taratibu hizo Roho Mtakatifu anafundisha wazi kwamba wakati ile hema ya nje ingali ipo imesimama , njia ya kuingia Mahali Patakatifu haijafunguliwa . "
b.HEB.9.9,"Which was a figure for the time then present , in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices , that could not make him that did the service perfect , as pertaining to the conscience ; ",b.HEB.9.9,"Jambo hili ni mfano wa nyakati za sasa . Linaonyesha kwamba zawadi na dhabihu zinazotolewa kwa Mungu haziwezi kuifanya mioyo ya wale wanaoabudu kuwa mikamilifu , "
b.HEB.9.10,"Which stood only in meats and drinks , and divers washings , and carnal ordinances , imposed on them until the time of reformation . ",b.HEB.9.10,"kwani haya yote yanahusika na vyakula , vinywaji na taratibu mbalimbali za kutawadha . Yote hayo ni maagizo ya njenje tu ; na nguvu yake hukoma wakati Mungu atakaporekebisha vitu vyote . "
b.HEB.9.11,"But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come , by a greater and more perfect tabernacle , not made with hands , that is to say , not of this building ; ",b.HEB.9.11,"Lakini Kristo amekwisha fika , akiwa Kuhani Mkuu wa mambo yaliyo mema , ambayo sasa yamekwisha fika . Yeye anatoa huduma zake katika hema iliyo bora na kamilifu zaidi , isiyofanywa kwa mikono ya watu , yaani isiyo ya ulimwengu huu ulioumbwa . "
b.HEB.9.12,"Neither by the blood of goats and calves , but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place , having obtained eternal redemption for us . ",b.HEB.9.12,"Yeye aliingia Mahali Patakatifu mara moja tu , tena hakuwa amechukua damu ya mbuzi wala ng ' ombe , bali aliingia kwa damu yake yeye mwenyewe , akatupatia ukombozi wa milele . "
b.HEB.9.13,"For if the blood of bulls and of goats , and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean , sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh : ",b.HEB.9.13,Watu waliokuwa najisi kidini waliweza kutakasika na kuwa safi waliponyunyiziwa damu ya mbuzi na ya ng ' ombe pamoja na majivu ya ndama . 
b.HEB.9.14,"How much more shall the blood of Christ , who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God , purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God ? ",b.HEB.9.14,"Lakini , kwa damu ya Kristo , mambo makuu zaidi hufanyika ! Kwa nguvu za Roho wa milele , Kristo alijitolea mwenyewe dhabihu kamilifu kwa Mungu . Damu yake itatutakasa dhamiri zetu kutokana na matendo yaletayo kifo , ili tupate kumtumikia Mungu aliye hai . "
b.HEB.9.15,"And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament , that by means of death , for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament , they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance . ",b.HEB.9.15,"Kwa hiyo , Kristo ndiye aliyeratibisha agano jipya ili wale walioitwa na Mungu wazipokee baraka za milele walizoahidiwa . Watazipata , kwani kifo kimetokea ambacho huwakomboa watu kutoka yale makosa waliyofanya wakati wa lile agano la kale . "
b.HEB.9.16,"For where a testament is , there must also of necessity be the death of the testator . ",b.HEB.9.16,Kwa kawaida wosia hutambuliwa tu kama kifo cha yule aliyeufanya huo wosia kimethibitishwa . 
b.HEB.9.17,For a testament is of force after men are dead : otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth . ,b.HEB.9.17,"Wosia hauwezi kutekelezwa mpaka kumetokea kifo , kwani wosia hauna maana ikiwa mwenye kuufanya bado anaishi . "
b.HEB.9.18,Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood . ,b.HEB.9.18,Ndiyo maana hata lile agano la kwanza halikuwekwa bila damu kumwagwa . 
b.HEB.9.19,"For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law , he took the blood of calves and of goats , with water , and scarlet wool , and hyssop , and sprinkled both the book , and all the people , ",b.HEB.9.19,"Kwanza Mose aliwatangazia watu wote amri zote kama ilivyokuwa katika Sheria ; kisha akachukua damu ya ndama pamoja na maji , na kwa kutumia majani ya mti uitwao husopo na pamba nyekundu , akakinyunyizia kile kitabu cha Sheria na hao watu wote . "
b.HEB.9.20,"Saying , This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you . ",b.HEB.9.20,"Mose alisema : "" Hii ni damu inayothibitisha agano mliloamriwa na Mungu mlitii . "" "
b.HEB.9.21,"Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle , and all the vessels of the ministry . ",b.HEB.9.21,Vilevile Mose aliinyunyizia damu ile hema na vyombo vya ibada . 
b.HEB.9.22,And almost all things are by the law purged with blood ; and without shedding of blood is no remission . ,b.HEB.9.22,"Naam , kadiri ya Sheria karibu kila kitu chaweza kutakaswa kwa damu , na dhambi nazo zaondolewa tu ikiwa damu imemwagwa . "
b.HEB.9.23,It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these ; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these . ,b.HEB.9.23,"Vitu hivi ambavyo ni mfano tu wa mambo halisi ya mbinguni , vililazimika kutakaswa kwa namna hiyo . Lakini vitu vya mbinguni huhitaji dhabihu iliyo bora zaidi . "
b.HEB.9.24,"For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands , which are the figures of the true ; but into heaven itself , now to appear in the presence of God for us : ",b.HEB.9.24,"Maana Kristo hakuingia Mahali Patakatifu palipojengwa kwa mikono ya watu , ambapo ni mfano tu wa kile kilicho halisi . yeye aliingia mbinguni kwenyewe ambako sasa anasimama mbele ya Mungu kwa ajili yetu . "
b.HEB.9.25,"Nor yet that he should offer himself often , as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others ; ",b.HEB.9.25,"Kuhani Mkuu wa Wayahudi huingia Mahali Patakatifu kila mwaka akiwa amechukua damu ya mnyama ; lakini Kristo hakuingia humo ili ajitoe mwenyewe mara nyingi , "
b.HEB.9.26,For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world : but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself . ,b.HEB.9.26,"maana ingalikuwa hivyo , Kristo angalipaswa kuteswa mara nyingi tangu kuumbwa ulimwengu . Lakini sasa nyakati hizi zinapokaribia mwisho wake , yeye ametokea mara moja tu , kuondoa dhambi kwa kujitoa yeye mwenyewe dhabihu . "
b.HEB.9.27,"And as it is appointed unto men once to die , but after this the judgment : ",b.HEB.9.27,"Basi , kama vile kila mtu hufa mara moja tu , kisha husimama mbele ya hukumu ya Mungu , "
b.HEB.9.28,So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many ; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation . ,b.HEB.9.28,"vivyo hivyo Kristo naye alijitoa dhabihu mara moja tu kwa ajili ya kuziondoa dhambi za wengi . Atakapotokea mara ya pili si kwa ajili ya kupambana na dhambi , bali ni kwa ajili ya kuwaokoa wale wanaomngojea . "
b.HEB.10.1,"For the law having a shadow of good things to come , and not the very image of the things , can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect . ",b.HEB.10.1,"Sheria ya Wayahudi si picha kamili ya mambo yale halisi : ni kivuli tu cha mema yanayokuja . Dhabihu zilezile hutolewa daima , mwaka baada ya mwaka . Sheria yawezaje , basi , kwa njia ya dhabihu hizo , kuwafanya wale wanaoabudu wawe wakamilifu ? "
b.HEB.10.2,For then would they not have ceased to be offered ? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins . ,b.HEB.10.2,"Kama hao watu wanaomwabudu Mungu wangekuwa wametakaswa dhambi zao kweli , hawangejisikia tena kuwa na dhambi , na dhabihu hizo zote zingekoma . "
b.HEB.10.3,But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year . ,b.HEB.10.3,Lakini dhabihu hizo hufanyika kila mwaka kuwakumbusha watu dhambi zao . 
b.HEB.10.4,For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins . ,b.HEB.10.4,Maana damu ya fahali na mbuzi haiwezi kamwe kuondoa dhambi . 
b.HEB.10.5,"Wherefore when he cometh into the world , he saith , Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not , but a body hast thou prepared me : ",b.HEB.10.5,"Ndiyo maana Kristo alipokuwa anakuja ulimwenguni , alimwambia Mungu : "" Hukutaka dhabihu wala sadaka , lakini umenitayarishia mwili . "
b.HEB.10.6,In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure . ,b.HEB.10.6,Sadaka za kuteketezwa au za kuondoa dhambi hazikupendezi . 
b.HEB.10.7,"Then said I , Lo , I come ( in the volume of the book it is written of me , ) to do thy will , O God . ",b.HEB.10.7,"Hapo nikasema : Niko hapa ee Mungu , tayari kufanya mapenzi yako kama ilivyoandikwa juu yangu katika kitabu cha Sheria . "" "
b.HEB.10.8,"Above when he said , Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not , neither hadst pleasure therein ; which are offered by the law ; ",b.HEB.10.8,"Kwanza alisema : "" Hutaki , wala hupendezwi na dhabihu na sadaka , sadaka za kuteketezwa na za kuondoa dhambi . "" Alisema hivyo ingawa sadaka hizi zote hutolewa kufuatana na Sheria . "
b.HEB.10.9,"Then said he , Lo , I come to do thy will , O God . He taketh away the first , that he may establish the second . ",b.HEB.10.9,"Kisha akasema : "" Niko hapa , ee Mungu , tayari kufanya mapenzi yako . "" Hivyo Mungu alibatilisha dhabihu za zamani na mahali pake akaweka dhabihu nyingine moja . "
b.HEB.10.10,By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all . ,b.HEB.10.10,"Kwa kuwa Yesu Kristo alitimiza mapenzi ya Mungu , sisi tunatakaswa dhambi zetu kwa ile dhabihu ya mwili wake aliyotoa mara moja tu , ikatosha . "
b.HEB.10.11,"And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices , which can never take away sins : ",b.HEB.10.11,"Kila kuhani Myahudi humhudumia Mungu kila siku , akitoa dhabibu zilezile mara nyingi , dhabibu ambazo haziwezi kuondoa dhambi . "
b.HEB.10.12,"But this man , after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever , sat down on the right hand of God ; ",b.HEB.10.12,"Lakini Kristo alitoa dhabihu moja tu kwa ajili ya dhambi , dhabihu ifaayo milele , kisha akaketi upande wa kulia wa Mungu . "
b.HEB.10.13,From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool . ,b.HEB.10.13,Huko anangoja mpaka adui zake watakapowekwa kama kibao chini ya miguu yake . 
b.HEB.10.14,For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified . ,b.HEB.10.14,"Basi , kwa dhabihu yake moja tu , amewafanya kuwa wakamilifu milele wale wanaotakaswa dhambi zao . "
b.HEB.10.15,"Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us : for after that he had said before , ",b.HEB.10.15,Naye Roho Mtakatifu anatupa ushahidi wake . Kwanza anasema : 
b.HEB.10.16,"This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days , saith the Lord , I will put my laws into their hearts , and in their minds will I write them ; ",b.HEB.10.16," "" Hili ndilo agano nitakalofanya nao , katika siku zijazo , asema Bwana : Nitaweka sheria zangu mioyoni mwao , na kuziandika akilini mwao . "" "
b.HEB.10.17,And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more . ,b.HEB.10.17,"Kisha akaongeza kusema : "" Sitakumbuka tena dhambi zao , wala vitendo vyao vya uhalifu . "" "
b.HEB.10.18,"Now where remission of these is , there is no more offering for sin . ",b.HEB.10.18,"Basi , dhambi zikisha ondolewa , hakutakuwa na haja tena ya kutoa dhabihu za kuondoa dhambi . "
b.HEB.10.19,"Having therefore , brethren , boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus , ",b.HEB.10.19,"Basi , ndugu , kwa damu ya Yesu tunapewa moyo thabiti wa kuingia Mahali Patakatifu . "
b.HEB.10.20,"By a new and living way , which he hath consecrated for us , through the veil , that is to say , his flesh ; ",b.HEB.10.20,"Yeye ametufungulia njia mpya na yenye uzima kupitia lile pazia , yaani kwa njia ya mwili wake mwenyewe . "
b.HEB.10.21,And having an high priest over the house of God ; ,b.HEB.10.21,"Basi , tunaye kuhani maarufu aliye na mamlaka juu ya nyumba ya Mungu . "
b.HEB.10.22,"Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith , having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience , and our bodies washed with pure water . ",b.HEB.10.22,"Kwa hiyo tumkaribie Mungu kwa moyo mnyofu na imani timilifu , kwa mioyo iliyotakaswa dhamiri mbaya , na kwa miili iliyosafishwa kwa maji safi . "
b.HEB.10.23,Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering ; ( for he is faithful that promised ; ) ,b.HEB.10.23,"Tushikilie imara tumaini lile tunalokiri , maana Mungu aliyefanya ahadi zake ni mwaminifu . "
b.HEB.10.24,And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works : ,b.HEB.10.24,Tujitahidi kushughulikiana kwa ajili ya kuongezeana bidii ya kupendana na kutenda mema . 
b.HEB.10.25,"Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together , as the manner of some is ; but exhorting one another : and so much the more , as ye see the day approaching . ",b.HEB.10.25,"Tusiache ile desturi ya kukutana pamoja , kama vile wengine wanavyofanya . Bali tunapaswa kusaidiana kwani , kama mwonavyo , Siku ile ya Bwana inakaribia . "
b.HEB.10.26,"For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth , there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins , ",b.HEB.10.26,"Maana , tukiendelea kutenda dhambi makusudi baada ya kufahamu ukweli , hakuna dhabihu iwezayo kutolewa tena kwa ajili ya kuondoa dhambi . "
b.HEB.10.27,"But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation , which shall devour the adversaries . ",b.HEB.10.27,Linalobaki ni kungojea tu kwa hofu hukumu ya Mungu na moto mkali utakaowaangamiza wote wanaompinga . 
b.HEB.10.28,He that despised Moses ' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses : ,b.HEB.10.28,"Mtu yeyote asiyeitii Sheria ya Mose , huuawa bila ya huruma kukiwa na ushahidi wa watu wawili au watatu . "
b.HEB.10.29,"Of how much sorer punishment , suppose ye , shall he be thought worthy , who hath trodden under foot the Son of God , and hath counted the blood of the covenant , wherewith he was sanctified , an unholy thing , and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace ? ",b.HEB.10.29,"Je , mtu yule anayempuuza Mwana wa Mungu na kuidharau damu ya agano la Mungu iliyomtakasa , mtu anayemtukana Roho wa Mungu , anastahili kupata adhabu kali ya namna gani ? "
b.HEB.10.30,"For we know him that hath said , Vengeance belongeth unto me , I will recompense , saith the Lord . And again , The Lord shall judge his people . ",b.HEB.10.30,"Maana tunamfahamu yule aliyesema , "" Mimi nitalipiza kisasi , mimi nitalipiza , "" na ambaye alisema pia , "" Bwana atawahukumu watu wake . "" "
b.HEB.10.31,It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God . ,b.HEB.10.31,Kuanguka mikononi mwa Mungu aliye hai ni jambo la kutisha mno ! 
b.HEB.10.32,"But call to remembrance the former days , in which , after ye were illuminated , ye endured a great fight of afflictions ; ",b.HEB.10.32,"Kumbukeni yaliyotokea siku zile za kwanza mlipoangaziwa mwanga wa Mungu . Ingawa siku zile mlipatwa na mateso mengi , ninyi mlistahimili . "
b.HEB.10.33,"Partly , whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions ; and partly , whilst ye became companions of them that were so used . ",b.HEB.10.33,Mara nyingine mlitukanwa na kufedheheshwa hadharani ; mara nyingine mlikuwa radhi kuungana na wale walioteswa namna hiyohiyo . 
b.HEB.10.34,"For ye had compassion of me in my bonds , and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods , knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance . ",b.HEB.10.34,"Mlishiriki mateso ya wafungwa , na mliponyang ' anywa mali yenu mlistahimili kwa furaha , maana mlijua kwamba mnayo mali bora zaidi na ya kudumu milele . "
b.HEB.10.35,"Cast not away therefore your confidence , which hath great recompence of reward . ",b.HEB.10.35,"Basi , msipoteze uhodari wenu , maana utawapatieni tuzo kubwa . "
b.HEB.10.36,"For ye have need of patience , that , after ye have done the will of God , ye might receive the promise . ",b.HEB.10.36,"Mnahitaji kuwa na uvumilivu , ili mweze kufanya anayotaka Mungu na kupokea kile alichoahidi . "
b.HEB.10.37,"For yet a little while , and he that shall come will come , and will not tarry . ",b.HEB.10.37,"Maana kama yasemavyo Maandiko : "" Bado kidogo tu , na yule anayekuja , atakuja , wala hatakawia . "
b.HEB.10.38,"Now the just shall live by faith : but if any man draw back , my soul shall have no pleasure in him . ",b.HEB.10.38,"Lakini mtu wangu aliye mwadilifu ataamini na kuishi ; walakini akirudi nyuma , mimi sitapendezwa naye . "" "
b.HEB.10.39,But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition ; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul . ,b.HEB.10.39,"Basi , sisi hatumo miongoni mwa wale wanaorudi nyuma na kupotea , ila sisi tunaamini na tunaokolewa . "
b.HEB.11.1,"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for , the evidence of things not seen . ",b.HEB.11.1,Kuwa na imani ni kuwa na hakika ya mambo tunayotumainia ; kusadiki kabisa mambo tusiyoyaona . 
b.HEB.11.2,For by it the elders obtained a good report . ,b.HEB.11.2,Maana wazee wa kale walipata kibali cha Mungu kwa sababu ya imani yao . 
b.HEB.11.3,"Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God , so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear . ",b.HEB.11.3,Kwa imani sisi tunafahamu kwamba ulimwengu uliumbwa kwa neno la Mungu ; vitu vinavyoonekana kutoka vitu visivyoonekana . 
b.HEB.11.4,"By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain , by which he obtained witness that he was righteous , God testifying of his gifts : and by it he being dead yet speaketh . ",b.HEB.11.4,"Kwa imani Abeli alimtolea Mungu dhabihu iliyokuwa bora zaidi kuliko ile ya Kaini . Kwa imani yake alikubaliwa na Mungu kuwa mwadilifu ; Mungu mwenyewe alizikubali sadaka zake . Kwa imani yake ingawa amekufa , bado ananena . "
b.HEB.11.5,"By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death ; and was not found , because God had translated him : for before his translation he had this testimony , that he pleased God . ",b.HEB.11.5,"Kwa imani Henoki alichukuliwa na Mungu , asipate kufa . Hakuonekana tena kwa sababu Mungu alikuwa amemchukua . Maandiko yasema kwamba kabla ya kuchukuliwa kwake , yeye alikuwa amempendeza Mungu . "
b.HEB.11.6,"But without faith it is impossible to please him : for he that cometh to God must believe that he is , and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him . ",b.HEB.11.6,"Basi , pasipo imani haiwezekani kumpendeza Mungu . Kwa maana kila mtu anayemwendea Mungu ni lazima aamini kwamba Mungu yuko , na kwamba huwatuza wale wanaomtafuta . "
b.HEB.11.7,"By faith Noah , being warned of God of things not seen as yet , moved with fear , prepared an ark to the saving of his house ; by the which he condemned the world , and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith . ",b.HEB.11.7,"Kwa imani Noa alionywa na Mungu juu ya mambo ya baadaye ambayo hakuweza kuyaona bado . Alimtii Mungu , akajenga ile safina ambamo aliokolewa yeye pamoja na jamaa yake . Kutokana na hayo ulimwengu ulihukumiwa , naye Noa akapokea uadilifu unaotokana na imani . "
b.HEB.11.8,"By faith Abraham , when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance , obeyed ; and he went out , not knowing whither he went . ",b.HEB.11.8,"Kwa imani Abrahamu alimtii Mungu alipoitwa aende katika nchi ambayo Mungu angempa iwe yake . Ingawa hakujua alikokuwa anakwenda , Abrahamu alihama . "
b.HEB.11.9,"By faith he sojourned in the land of promise , as in a strange country , dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob , the heirs with him of the same promise : ",b.HEB.11.9,"Kwa imani aliishi kama mgeni katika nchi aliyoahidiwa na Mungu . Aliishi huko katika hema kama walivyoishi Isaka na Yakobo , ambao pia walishiriki ahadi ileile . "
b.HEB.11.10,"For he looked for a city which hath foundations , whose builder and maker is God . ",b.HEB.11.10,"Maana Abrahamu alikuwa akingojea mji wenye misingi imara , mji ambao Mungu mwenyewe ndiye fundi aliyeubuni na kuujenga . "
b.HEB.11.11,"Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed , and was delivered of a child when she was past age , because she judged him faithful who had promised . ",b.HEB.11.11,"Kwa imani hata Sara aliamini kwamba Mungu hutimiza ahadi zake , kwa hiyo akajaliwa kuchukua mimba ingawaje alikuwa amepita umri . "
b.HEB.11.12,"Therefore sprang there even of one , and him as good as dead , so many as the stars of the sky in multitude , and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable . ",b.HEB.11.12,"Kwa hiyo , kutoka katika mtu huyo mmoja , Abrahamu , ambaye alikuwa kama amekufa , walitokea watu wengi wasiohesabika kama vile nyota za mbinguni na mchanga wa pwani . "
b.HEB.11.13,"These all died in faith , not having received the promises , but having seen them afar off , and were persuaded of them , and embraced them , and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth . ",b.HEB.11.13,"Watu hawa wote walikufa wakiwa na imani . Walikufa kabla ya kupokea mambo ambayo Mungu alikuwa ameahidi , lakini kwa mbali waliyaona , wakashangilia , na kukiri wazi kwamba wao walikuwa wageni na wakimbizi duniani . "
b.HEB.11.14,For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country . ,b.HEB.11.14,"Watu wanaosema mambo kama hayo , huonyesha wazi kwamba wanaitafuta nchi yao wenyewe . "
b.HEB.11.15,"And truly , if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out , they might have had opportunity to have returned . ",b.HEB.11.15,"Kama wangalikuwa wanaifikiria nchi walikotoka zamani , wangalipata nafasi ya kurudi huko . "
b.HEB.11.16,"But now they desire a better country , that is , an heavenly : wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God : for he hath prepared for them a city . ",b.HEB.11.16,"Lakini sasa wanataka nchi iliyo bora zaidi , yaani nchi ya mbinguni . Ndiyo maana Mungu haoni haya wakimwita yeye Mungu wao , kwa sababu yeye mwenyewe amekwisha watayarishia mji . "
b.HEB.11.17,"By faith Abraham , when he was tried , offered up Isaac : and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son , ",b.HEB.11.17,"Kwa imani , Abrahamu alimtoa mwanae Isaka sadaka wakati Mungu alipomjaribu .

b.HEB.11.22,"By faith Joseph , when he died , made mention of the departing of the children of Israel ; and gave commandment concerning his bones .

b.HEB.11.40,"God having provided some better thing for us , that they without us should not be made perfect . ",b.HEB.11.40,maana Mungu alikuwa ameazimia mpango ulio bora zaidi kwa ajili yetu ; yaani wao wangeufikia ukamilifu wakiwa pamoja nasi . 
b.HEB.12.1,"Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses , let us lay aside every weight , and the sin which doth so easily beset us , and let us run with patience the race that is set before us , ",b.HEB.12.1,"Sisi tunalo kundi hili kubwa la mashahidi mbele yetu .
