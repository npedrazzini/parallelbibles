b.JOH.4.43,"Now after two days he departed thence , and went into Galilee . ",b.JOH.4.43,Kepha emva kwezinsuku ezimbili waphuma lapho ukuya eGalile . 
b.JOH.4.44,"For Jesus himself testified , that a prophet hath no honour in his own country . ",b.JOH.4.44,Ngokuba uJesu uqobo wafakaza ngokuthi umprofethi kaziswa ezweni lakubo . 
b.JOH.4.45,"Then when he was come into Galilee , the Galilaeans received him , having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast : for they also went unto the feast .

b.JOH.4.46,"So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee , where he made the water wine . And there was a certain nobleman , whose son was sick at Capernaum .

b.JOH.4.54,"This is again the second miracle that Jesus did , when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee . ",b.JOH.4.54,Leso siyisibonakaliso sesibili uJesu asenza efikile eGalile evela eJudiya . 
b.JOH.5.1,After this there was a feast of the Jews ; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem . ,b.JOH.5.1,Emva kwalokho kwakukhona umkhosi wabaJuda ; uJesu wakhuphukela eJerusalema .
