b.ROM.6.1,"What shall we say then ? Shall we continue in sin , that grace may abound ? ",b.ROM.6.1,"So te mothas ? Beshas ando bezex , saxke te bariol o lashimos le Devlesko ? "

b.ROM.6.4,"Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death : that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father , even so we also should walk in newness of life .

b.ROM.6.7,For he that is dead is freed from sin . ,b.ROM.6.7,"Ke kodo kai mulo , o bezex ma nai les putiera . "
b.ROM.6.8,"Now if we be dead with Christ , we believe that we shall also live with him : ",b.ROM.6.8,"Te muliam le Kristosa , ame pachas ame ke traiisarasa lesa . "
b.ROM.6.9,Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more ; death hath no more dominion over him . ,b.ROM.6.9,"Zhanas ke o Kristo zhuvindisailo andal mule , ai nashti mai merel ; ke e martia ma nai la putiera pe leste . "

b.ROM.6.23,For the wages of sin is death ; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord . ,b.ROM.6.23,Ke e pochin le bezexeski si e martia ; numa e podarka le Devleski kai si dini ivia si o traio kai chi mai getolpe le Jesus Kristosa amaro Del .

b.ROM.7.3,"So then if , while her husband liveth , she be married to another man , she shall be called an adulteress : but if her husband be dead , she is free from that law ; so that she is no adulteress , though she be married to another man .

b.ROM.7.4,"Wherefore , my brethren , ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ ; that ye should be married to another , even to him who is raised from the dead , that we should bring forth fruit unto God .

b.ROM.7.5,"For when we were in the flesh , the motions of sins , which were by the law , did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death .

b.ROM.7.13,"Was then that which is good made death unto me ? God forbid .

b.ROM.7.18,"For I know that in me ( that is , in my flesh , ) dwelleth no good thing : for to will is present with me ; but how to perform that which is good I find not .

b.ROM.7.22,For I delight in the law of God after the inward man : ,b.ROM.7.22,Ke voliv o zakono le Devlesko ande murho ilo . 
b.ROM.7.23,"But I see another law in my members , warring against the law of my mind , and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members .

b.ROM.7.24,O wretched man that I am ! who shall deliver me from the body of this death ? ,b.ROM.7.24,Che chinuime manush sim ! Kon skepila ma anda kado stato kai ingerel ma kai martia ? 
b.ROM.7.25,I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord .

b.ROM.8.1,"There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus , who walk not after the flesh , but after the Spirit . ",b.ROM.8.1,"Akana ma nai chi iek kris pe kodola kai traiin le Jesus Kristosa , kai chi phiren na pala stato , numa pala Swunto Duxo . "
b.ROM.8.2,For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death . ,b.ROM.8.2,"Ke o zakono le Swuntone Duxosko kai del o traio ando Jesus Kristo , skepisardia ma anda zakono le bezexesko ai katar e martia . "
b.ROM.8.3,"For what the law could not do , in that it was weak through the flesh , God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh , and for sin , condemned sin in the flesh : ",b.ROM.8.3,"O Del kerdia so o zakono le Mosesosko nashti kerelas , ke o stato le manushesko nai zuralo .

b.ROM.8.4,"That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us , who walk not after the flesh , but after the Spirit . ",b.ROM.8.4,"Ai O Del kerdia kodia saxke e kris le zakonoski te kerdiol anda amende kai phiras na pala stato , numa pala Swunto Duxo . "
b.ROM.8.5,For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh ; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit . ,b.ROM.8.5,"Ke kodola kai traiin pala stato , roden le dieli kai mangel o stato . Numa kodola kay traiin pala Swunto Duxo lenpe pala so mangel o Swunto Duxo . "
b.ROM.8.6,For to be carnally minded is death ; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace . ,b.ROM.8.6,Te lesa tu pala le dieli kai mangel o stato kodia angerel kai martia ; numa te lesa tu pala so mangel o Swunto Duxo kodia angerel ando traio ai kai pacha . 
b.ROM.8.7,"Because the carnal mind is enmity against God : for it is not subject to the law of God , neither indeed can be . ",b.ROM.8.7,"Ke kodola kai lenpe pala le dieli le statoske , won si le duzhmaia le Devleske ; ke chi lenpe pala zakono le Devlesko , ai vi nashtin . "
b.ROM.8.8,So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God . ,b.ROM.8.8,Kodola kai traiin le statoske nashtin te aven drago le Devleske . 
b.ROM.8.9,"But ye are not in the flesh , but in the Spirit , if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you . Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ , he is none of his .

b.ROM.8.18,For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us . ,b.ROM.8.18,Gindiv ke o chino kai dikhas akana nashtil te avel iekfialo ke sar o luvudimos le Devlesko kai O Del sikavela amenge .

b.ROM.8.23,"And not only they , but ourselves also , which have the firstfruits of the Spirit , even we ourselves groan within ourselves , waiting for the adoption , to wit , the redemption of our body .

b.HEB.3.11,"So I sware in my wrath , They shall not enter into my rest . ) ",b.HEB.3.11,"Simas xoliariko lensa ai me phendem mange , "" Won chi avena andre ai hodinin mansa . "" "
b.HEB.3.12,"Take heed , brethren , lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief , in departing from the living God . ",b.HEB.3.12,"Murhe phral , arakhen tume , te na arakhes o nasulimos ande chi iek manush mashkar tumende , ke o ilo kai chi pachal ingerel les dur katar O Del o zhuvindil . "
b.HEB.3.13,"But exhort one another daily , while it is called To day ; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin . ",b.HEB.3.13,"Zhutin iek kavreste . De duma swako dies iek kavresa kana si vriama , ai cho ilo chi avela zuralo , ai chi peres ando atsaimos le bezexesko . "
b.HEB.3.14,"For we are made partakers of Christ , if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end ; ",b.HEB.3.14,"Ke ame sam le Kristoske te inkeras amaro pachamos ande leste sa data zhando gor , sar pachaiam ame ande leste mai anglal . "
b.HEB.3.15,"While it is said , To day if ye will hear his voice , harden not your hearts , as in the provocation . ",b.HEB.3.15,"E Vorba le Devleski phenel , "" Adies , te ashunes lesko glaso , na mek cho ilo te avel zuralo sar tumare phure dada kerde ande pusta , kana won chi kerde so manglia O Del lendar . "" "
b.HEB.3.16,"For some , when they had heard , did provoke : howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses . ",b.HEB.3.16,"Kon sas kodole manush kai ashunde o glaso le Devlesko ande pusta , ai chi mangle te keren so manglia O Del lendar ? Sa le manush kai avile andai Egypt le Mosesosa . "
b.HEB.3.17,"But with whom was he grieved forty years ? was it not with them that had sinned , whose carcases fell in the wilderness ? ",b.HEB.3.17,"Kasa sas O Del xoliariko shtarvardesh bersh ? Sas kodolensa kai kerde bezex ai mule , ai sas gropome ande pusta . "
b.HEB.3.18,"And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest , but to them that believed not ? ",b.HEB.3.18,"Ai kaske phenelas O Del , kana armandino ek solaxasa , "" Nashti zhan ande phuv kai Wo shinadia lenge . "" Sas kodolensa kai chi kerde so manglia O Del . "
b.HEB.3.19,So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief . ,b.HEB.3.19,"Ai sostar chi gele andre te hodinin lesa , ke won chi pachaiepe . "
b.HEB.4.1,"Let us therefore fear , lest , a promise being left us of entering into his rest , any of you should seem to come short of it . ",b.HEB.4.1,"Ai so shinadia lenge O Del ? Wo phendia ka sa le manush , "" Te mangen te zhan andre ai hodinin mansa , tume sai zhan andre . "" Trobul ame te izdras la darasa ke uni chi zhan andre . "
b.HEB.4.2,"For unto us was the gospel preached , as well as unto them : but the word preached did not profit them , not being mixed with faith in them that heard it . ",b.HEB.4.2,"Ame ashundiam e lashi viasta kai O Del mangel te skepil ame , sar won ashunde e lashi viasta , numa e Vorba chi zhutisardia le ke nas le pachamos . "
b.HEB.4.3,"For we which have believed do enter into rest , as he said , As I have sworn in my wrath , if they shall enter into my rest : although the works were finished from the foundation of the world . ",b.HEB.4.3,"Ame kai pachas sai zhas andre ai hodinis lesa . O Del phendia , "" Simas xoliariko ai phendem , ' Won chi avena andre ai hodinin mansa . ' "" Makar e buchi le Devleski gata sas palal Wo kerdia e lumia . "
b.HEB.4.4,"For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise , And God did rest the seventh day from all his works . ",b.HEB.4.4,"Ame zhanas kai wo si gata ai azhukerel ame , ke si ramome kai O Del hodinisardia po eftato dies palal wo kerdia e lumia ai sa le dieli pe phuv . "
b.HEB.4.5,"And in this place again , If they shall enter into my rest . ",b.HEB.4.5,"Numa wo chi gele andre , ke O Del phendia , "" Won chi aven andre ai hodinin mansa . "" "
b.HEB.4.6,"Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein , and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief : ",b.HEB.4.6,"Uni zhan andre te hodinin le Devlesa , numa kodole kai ashunde e lashi viasta ai chi kerde sar manglia O Del lendar chi avile andre te hodinin le Devlesa . "
b.HEB.4.7,"Again , he limiteth a certain day , saying in David , To day , after so long a time ; as it is said , To day if ye will hear his voice , harden not your hearts . ",b.HEB.4.7,"O Del thodia rigate iek dies le manushenge te aven andre , ai kadia vriama si "" Adies "" . De but bersh palpale kana le manush chi avile andre o David phendia , "" Adies te ashunen o glaso le Devlesko , te na zuravon che ile . "" "
b.HEB.4.8,"For if Jesus had given them rest , then would he not afterward have spoken of another day . ",b.HEB.4.8,"Ke o Joshua nashtisardia te ingerel kodole manushen andre te hodinin le Devlesa , O Del chi trobulas te del duma mai palal pa aver dies . "
b.HEB.4.9,There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God . ,b.HEB.4.9,Si ek hodinimos kai azhukerel le shavenge le Devleske . 
b.HEB.4.10,"For he that is entered into his rest , he also hath ceased from his own works , as God did from his . ",b.HEB.4.10,"O manush kai avel andre te hodinil le Devlesa , hodinil katar peski buchi sar O Del hodinisardia katar peski buchi . "
b.HEB.4.11,"Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest , lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief . ",b.HEB.4.11,"Mek ame te keras vorta angla Del te zhas andre te hodinis le Devlesa , te na keras vorta ame avasa sar le manush kai chi gele andre te hodinin le Devlesa . "
b.HEB.4.12,"For the word of God is quick , and powerful , and sharper than any twoedged sword , piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit , and of the joints and marrow , and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart . ",b.HEB.4.12,"E Vorba le Devleski zhuvindil ai pherdi leski putierasa ; E Vorba skurto sar ek sabia , kai shinel sigo andre kai si amare ginduria , ai amaro duxo , ai hulavel le , shinel le kokola ai kotora , phenel pa so gindil ai so mangel o ilo . "
b.HEB.4.13,Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight : but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do . ,b.HEB.4.13,"O Del zhanel pa swako manush , ai wo nashti garavel kanchi katar O Del . Leske iakha dikhen swako fielo kai ame keras . Musai das ame atweto ka Del pala so kerdiam . "
b.HEB.4.14,"Seeing then that we have a great high priest , that is passed into the heavens , Jesus the Son of God , let us hold fast our profession . ",b.HEB.4.14,"Numa O Jesus O Shav le Devlesko si amaro Baro Rasha kai gelo ando rhaio te beshel le Devlesa , ai te zhutil amen te zhas ka Del . Shoxar chi aterdios te pachas ande leste . "
b.HEB.4.15,"For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities ; but was in all points tempted like as we are , yet without sin . ",b.HEB.4.15,"Amaro Baro Rasha haliarel kai ame sam kovlo . O Kristo sas zumado sar ame , numa wo chi kerdia bezex . "
b.HEB.4.16,"Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace , that we may obtain mercy , and find grace to help in time of need . ",b.HEB.4.16,"Zhas le pachamasa ka o than le Devlesko ai beshas kotse te premis leski mila , ai te arakhas lesko mishtimos te zhutil ame kana trobul ame o zhutimos . "
b.HEB.5.1,"For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God , that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins : ",b.HEB.5.1,"O Zhidovisko baro rasha si ferdi o manush kai si alome katar leske manushen , ai wo del le podarki lenge po altari ka Del , ai del o rat katar le zhigeni kai si sakrifisarde pala le bezexa le manushenge te avena iertime le ai pala peske bezexa te avel iertime . "
b.HEB.5.2,"Who can have compassion on the ignorant , and on them that are out of the way ; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity . ",b.HEB.5.2,"O rasha si ek manush ai univar si kovlo . Wo si lasho kodolensa kai chi zhanen ai shubinpe , ke wo zhanel sar te zhutil le kai chi keren vorta . "
b.HEB.5.3,"And by reason hereof he ought , as for the people , so also for himself , to offer for sins . ",b.HEB.5.3,"Ai ke o rasha si kovlo , wo musai del le sakrifikaturia pala peske bezexa ai na ferdi le manushenge . "
b.HEB.5.4,"And no man taketh this honour unto himself , but he that is called of God , as was Aaron . ",b.HEB.5.4,"Na bustres ke o manush chi alosarel pes te avela o baro rasha ke wo mangel te avela o baro rasha , numa O Del akharel les pala leski buchi sar O Del alosardia o Aaron . "
b.HEB.5.5,"So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest ; but he that said unto him , Thou art my Son , to day have I begotten thee . ",b.HEB.5.5,"Ai vi O Kristo chi lia o luvudimos peste te avela o baro rasha , numa O Del alosardia les . O Del phendia leske , "" Murho Shav , adies me luvudisardem tut . "" "
b.HEB.5.6,"As he saith also in another place , Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec . ",b.HEB.5.6,"Aver data O Del phendia leske , "" Tu sanas alome te aves O Baro Rasha sa data , te avesa sar o Melchizedek . "" "
b.HEB.5.7,"Who in the days of his flesh , when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death , and was heard in that he feared ; ",b.HEB.5.7,"Kana O Jesus inker sas pe phuv , wo rhugisailo le tsipimasa ai le asuensa ka Del te sai skepil pes katar e martia . O Del ashundia leske rhugimata ke O Kristo luvudisardia O Del , ai kerdia so manglia O Del lestar . "
b.HEB.5.8,"Though he were a Son , yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered ; ",b.HEB.5.8,"O Kristo sas O Shav le Devlesko , numa wo sichilo te kerel so manglia O Del lestar pala lesko chinuimos . "
b.HEB.5.9,"And being made perfect , he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him ; ",b.HEB.5.9,"Wo kerdia vorta , Wo sas kerdilo O Skepitori te anel o skeipmos kai chi mai getolpe ka sa kodolen kai pachanpe ande leste , won aven skepime katar e kris le bezexeski . "
b.HEB.5.10,Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec . ,b.HEB.5.10,Seren tume ke O Del alosardia les te avela O Baro Rasha te lasharel o drom le manushenge te zhan ka Del . Wo sas sar o Melcizedek . 
b.HEB.5.11,"Of whom we have many things to say , and hard to be uttered , seeing ye are dull of hearing . ",b.HEB.5.11,"Mai si te phenas pa kadia dieli , numa trutno tumenge te haliaren , ke chi mangen te ashunen mishto . "
b.HEB.5.12,"For when for the time ye ought to be teachers , ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God ; and are become such as have need of milk , and not of strong meat . ",b.HEB.5.12,"Tume pachaiepe ando Del lungo vriana akana , ai trobulas te sicharen le kolaver manush , numa tume durile katar O Del ai tume trobul vari kon te sicharel tume mai iek data E Vorba le Devleski . Tume san sar le tsinorhe kai pen thud ferdi , ai chi xan xaben . "
b.HEB.5.13,For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness : for he is a babe . ,b.HEB.5.13,"Kana o manush pel thud dichol kai chi barilo ando Del , ai wo chi haliarel so si vorta ai so nai vorta . "
b.HEB.5.14,"But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age , even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil . ",b.HEB.5.14,"Numa xabe si pala o manush . O manush kai barilo ando Del , wo haliarel so si vorta ai so nai vorta . "
b.HEB.6.1,"Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ , let us go on unto perfection ; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works , and of faith toward God , ",b.HEB.6.1,"Mekas o pervo sicharimos kai trobul te zhanas pa Kristo , ai zhas angle le Devlesa ande leski Vorba te haliaras mai mishto pa lesko chachimos . Tume vunzhe zhanen kai trobul te aven iertime pala tumare bezexa ai amboldenpe katar tumare bezexa , ai tume zhanen kai trobul te pachanpe ando Del . "
b.HEB.6.2,"Of the doctrine of baptisms , and of laying on of hands , and of resurrection of the dead , and of eternal judgment . ",b.HEB.6.2,"Tume chi trobul mai sicharimos pa bolimos , ai pa o manush kai thon le vas pe aver manush , ai o zhuvindimos andal mule , ai e kris kai chi mai getolpe . "
b.HEB.6.3,"And this will we do , if God permit . ",b.HEB.6.3,Zhas angle ! Ai keras kadia te mekel amen O Del . 
b.HEB.6.4,"For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened , and have tasted of the heavenly gift , and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost , ",b.HEB.6.4,"Chi zumavas te anas tu palpale ka Del mai iek data te haliaren e lashi viasta , kai zumadian le lashe dieli le rhaioske , ai premisardian chi partia katar le Swuntone Duxoske , "
b.HEB.6.5,"And have tasted the good word of God , and the powers of the world to come , ",b.HEB.6.5,"ai zhanen kai E Vorba le Devleski si lashi , ai haliaren pa le putieri la lumiake kai si te avel , "
b.HEB.6.6,"If they shall fall away , to renew them again unto repentance ; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh , and put him to an open shame . ",b.HEB.6.6,"ai porme amboldenpe katar O Del . Tu nashtis te anes tut te keis mai iek data ke karfosardian O Shav le Devlesko kal trushul mai iek data , ke chi manglian les , ai keres anda leste lazhal , ai mares mui lestar angla le manushen . "
b.HEB.6.7,"For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it , and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed , receiveth blessing from God : ",b.HEB.6.7,"Kadia si sar e phuv , dia breshind butivar pe phuv . "
b.HEB.6.8,"But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected , and is nigh unto cursing ; whose end is to be burned . ",b.HEB.6.8,"O Del kerel e phuv te bariol lashe fruti ai lashe legume , numa del chorhi char ferdi , nai kanchi . Avela vurhitsime ai pharhudia le iagasa . "
b.HEB.6.9,"But , beloved , we are persuaded better things of you , and things that accompany salvation , though we thus speak . ",b.HEB.6.9,"Murhe vortacha , sar phenas kadala vorbi , zhanas kai si mai lashe dieli tumenge , kai avena tumenge kana tume aven skepime . "
b.HEB.6.10,"For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love , which ye have shewed toward his name , in that ye have ministered to the saints , and do minister . ",b.HEB.6.10,"O Del sa data kerel so si vorta . Wo chi bustrel pa e buchi kai tume kerde te zhutin le shave le Devleske , ai e buchi kai tume keren akana te zhutin len . Chiri buchi sikavel chiri dragostia le Kristoski . "
b.HEB.6.11,And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end : ,b.HEB.6.11,"Ai mangas tume te sikaven e dragostia le kavrenge swako dies kai traiin pe phuv , zhando gor , te avela tume chi podarka . "
b.HEB.6.12,"That ye be not slothful , but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises . ",b.HEB.6.12,"Chi aven kandine . Numa keren sar won kai keren buchi la pachamasa ai rhavdasa , won premin so sas shinado lenge . "
b.HEB.6.13,"For when God made promise to Abraham , because he could swear by no greater , he sware by himself , ",b.HEB.6.13,"O Del shinadia le vorbi ka Abrahamos , Wo phendia le vorbi ando pesko anav ke nas aver kai sas mai baro . "
b.HEB.6.14,"Saying , Surely blessing I will bless thee , and multiplying I will multiply thee . ",b.HEB.6.14,"Wo phendia leske . "" Me swuntsava les butivar , ai dav les ek shav ai lestar avena but shave , le Zhiduvuria . "
b.HEB.6.15,"And so , after he had patiently endured , he obtained the promise . ",b.HEB.6.15,O Abraham azhukerdia ai O Del dia les so sas shinado leste . 
b.HEB.6.16,For men verily swear by the greater : and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife . ,b.HEB.6.16,"Kana o manush shinavel vari so , wo akharel vari kon kai si mai baro lestar te avel , ai wo kerel les te kerel so wo shindia , vai te dosharel les te na kerel so wo shinadia . Ai chi mai phenen kanch . "
b.HEB.6.17,"Wherein God , willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel , confirmed it by an oath : ",b.HEB.6.17,"Ai O Del shinadia vari so ka Abrham . Wo shinadia le vorbi ando pesko anav , O Del manglia te sikavel ka Abraham kai wo shoxar chi parhuvel leski vorba . "
b.HEB.6.18,"That by two immutable things , in which it was impossible for God to lie , we might have a strong consolation , who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us : ",b.HEB.6.18,"O Del dia amenge so Wo shinadia , ai Wo sikadia amenge kai Wo chi parhuvel leski vorba . O Del nashti xoxavel . Akana sa le manush kai zhan leste te aven skepime len zor , ke won zhanen kai O Del kerel so wo phendia . "
b.HEB.6.19,"Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul , both sure and stedfast , and which entereth into that within the veil ; ",b.HEB.6.19,Katse si ame ek pachamos pala amare duxuria kai lel ame ka leste ( ka Del ) palal le swuntone zanaveski le rhaioske . 
b.HEB.6.20,"Whither the forerunner is for us entered , even Jesus , made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec . ",b.HEB.6.20,"O Jesus vunzhe gelo kotse . Wo si amaro Baro Rasha sa data , ai lashardia o drom le manushesko te zhal ka Del . Wo si sar Melchizedek . "
b.HEB.7.1,"For this Melchisedec , king of Salem , priest of the most high God , who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings , and blessed him ; ",b.HEB.7.1,"O Melchizedek sas o amperato le Salemosko , ai vi ek rasha le Devlesko O Mai Baro Del . Kana o Abraham avilo palpale katar o marimos kai but amperatsi mule , o Melchizedek dikhlia le Abrahamos sar zhalas khere ai swuntsosardia les . "
b.HEB.7.2,"To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all ; first being by interpretation King of righteousness , and after that also King of Salem , which is , King of peace ; ",b.HEB.7.2,"O Abraham dia kal Melchizedek desh partia ( desh pek shel ) anda sa so nirisardia ande marimos . O anav ' Melchnizedek ' znachil , ' O amperato le chachimasko ' , ai porme ' O Salem ' znachil ' Pacha ' , ai wo si akhardo ' O amperato le pachako ' , ai ' O amperato le Salemosko ' . "
b.HEB.7.3,"Without father , without mother , without descent , having neither beginning of days , nor end of life ; but made like unto the Son of God ; abideth a priest continually . ",b.HEB.7.3,"O Melchizedek sas bi dadesa , bi deiasa , bi familiasa , ai nai kanchi kai si ramome pa leski familia . Nas biandilo ai chi mulo , numa lesko traio si sar O Shav le Devlesko , ek rasha sa data . "
b.HEB.7.4,"Now consider how great this man was , unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils . ",b.HEB.7.4,Ame sai dikhas sar baro o Melchizedek sas . O Abraham dia les desh partia anda sa kai nirisardia ande marimos . 
b.HEB.7.5,"And verily they that are of the sons of Levi , who receive the office of the priesthood , have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law , that is , of their brethren , though they come out of the loins of Abraham : ",b.HEB.7.5,"O Zhidovisko zakono phendia , le shave le Levionge kai si rashai te len desh pek shel katar lengo narodo , le Zhiduvuria , kai si le shave le Abrahamoske . "
b.HEB.7.6,"But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham , and blessed him that had the promises . ",b.HEB.7.6,"Numa o Melchizedek sikadia o respektimos kal Abraham , ai o Abraham premisardia so sas shinadia leske katar O Del . "
b.HEB.7.7,And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better . ,b.HEB.7.7,Kodo kai sikavel o respektimos si mai baro sar kodo kai premil o respektimos . 
b.HEB.7.8,"And here men that die receive tithes ; but there he receiveth them , of whom it is witnessed that he liveth . ",b.HEB.7.8,"Le Zhidovonge rashai , kai meren , premisarde desh partia . Numa si phendo kai o Melchizedel traiil . "
b.HEB.7.9,"And as I may so say , Levi also , who receiveth tithes , payed tithes in Abraham . ",b.HEB.7.9,"Ame sai phenas kai o Levi , o dat le Zhidovonge rashai pochindia desh partia kal Melchizedek pala o Abraham . "
b.HEB.7.10,"For he was yet in the loins of his father , when Melchisedec met him . ",b.HEB.7.10,"O Levi nas kerdilo inker , numa wo avilo andai vitsa le Abrahamoski kana o Abraham pochindia desh partia kal Mekchizedek . "
b.HEB.7.11,"If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood , ( for under it the people received the law , ) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec , and not be called after the order of Aaron ? ",b.HEB.7.11,"Te le Zhidovonge rashai ai lenge zakonuria dashtisardia te skepin ame . Sostar O Del tradia pesko Shav O Kristo sar ek Baro Rasha , sar o Melchizedek , sarte te tradel ame iek sar o Mekchizedek , ai nai iek andai vitsa le Aaronoski ? "
b.HEB.7.12,"For the priesthood being changed , there is made of necessity a change also of the law . ",b.HEB.7.12,"Ai kana e vitsa le rashange sas parhudia , o Zhidovisko zakono sas parhudia . "
b.HEB.7.13,"For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe , of which no man gave attendance at the altar . ",b.HEB.7.13,"Kadala vorbi phenel amenge pa Kristo kai avilo anda aver vitsa , ai le manush ande kadia vitsa shoxar chi kerde buchi kai altari . Won chi mudarde le zhigeni ai chi dine podarki po altari pala le bezexa le manushenge . "
b.HEB.7.14,For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda ; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood . ,b.HEB.7.14,"O Jesus avilo andai vitsa kai bushol Judah , O Moses chi ramosardia kanchi pa lende ke wo chi dia lenge kadia buchi te keren . "
b.HEB.7.15,"And it is yet far more evident : for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest , ",b.HEB.7.15,Ame dikhas kai aver rasha avilo . Wo si sar o Melchizedek . 
b.HEB.7.16,"Who is made , not after the law of a carnal commandment , but after the power of an endless life . ",b.HEB.7.16,"O Kristo chi kerdilo o baro rasha ke wo avilo andai vitsa le Leviongi sar o Zhidovisko zakono phendia , O Kristo avilo O Baro Rasha la putierasa katar o traio kai chi mai getolpe . "
b.HEB.7.17,"For he testifieth , Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec . ",b.HEB.7.17,"E Vorba le Devleski phenel pa Kristo , "" Tu san O Baro Rasha sa data sar o Melchizedek . "" "
b.HEB.7.18,For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof . ,b.HEB.7.18,"O Del thodia o zakono le Mosesosko rigate , ke le rashai kerde e buchi pala o skepimos , numa akana O Kristo avilo andai aver vitsa sar O Baro Rasha te skepil le manushen .

b.HEB.7.19,"For the law made nothing perfect , but the bringing in of a better hope did ; by the which we draw nigh unto God . ",b.HEB.7.19,"Kovlo sas o zakono ai nashtisardia te skepil le manushen . Ke o zakono le Mosesosko chi kerde le manushen vorta anglaDel . Numa akana ame sai pachas ande leste ai beshas pasha leste , ke O Kristo si amaro Baro Rasha . "
b.HEB.7.20,And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest : ,b.HEB.7.20,O Del shinadia amenge ke O Kristo si te avel O Baro Rasha sa data . 
b.HEB.7.21," ( For those priests were made without an oath ; but this with an oath by him that said unto him , The Lord sware and will not repent , Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec : ) ",b.HEB.7.21,"Wo chi phendia kadala vorbi pa le kaver rashai . Ferdi ka O Kristo O Del phendia , "" O Del phendia le vorbi ai shoxar chi parhuvel le vorbi . Tu san O Baro Rasha sa data , sar o Melchizedek . "" "
b.HEB.7.22,By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament . ,b.HEB.7.22,"Ke O Del dia amenge leski vorba , ai O Jesus kerdilo o nevo kontrakto kai si mai mishto amenge . "
b.HEB.7.23,"And they truly were many priests , because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death : ",b.HEB.7.23,Mai anglal kana sas le o kontrakto o phuro won trobulsarde but rashai . Kana iek mulo won trobulsarde aver te kerel leski buchi .

b.HEB.7.25,"Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him , seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them . ",b.HEB.7.25,"O Jesus skepil sa le manushen kai aven leste akana ai sa data . O Jesus skepil le katar e kris le bezexeski , ai wo traiil sa data te rhugilpe ande lende , ai won chi bustren kai wo shordia pesko rat pala lende . "
b.HEB.7.26,"For such an high priest became us , who is holy , harmless , undefiled , separate from sinners , and made higher than the heavens ; ",b.HEB.7.26,"Trobul ame ek baro rasha sar O Jesus , ke wo si swunto , ai nai dosh ande leste , Wo chi kerdia bezex , ai nai marime sar le manush kai keren bezex , ai si les o than le luvudimasko ando rhaio . "
b.HEB.7.27,"Who needeth not daily , as those high priests , to offer up sacrifice , first for his own sins , and then for the people ' s : for this he did once , when he offered up himself . ",b.HEB.7.27,"O Kristo chi trobul o rat le zhigeni pala o sakrifis swako dies pala peste , sar le kaver rashai trobulsarde te keren te vuzharen penge bezexa , ai porme le bezexa le manushenge . O Kristo chi kerdia so won kerde . Numa Wo dia iek podarka po altari kana Wo dia pesko traio po trushul . Wo sas o sakrifis . "
b.HEB.7.28,"For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity ; but the word of the oath , which was since the law , maketh the Son , who is consecrated for evermore . ",b.HEB.7.28,"O Zhidovisko zakono kerel rashai le manushenge , numa le rashai sas kovle , ai kerde bezex , ai chi kerde vorta angla Del sa data . Numa mai palal O Del alosardia pesko Shav kai kerdia vorta angla leste sa data . "
b.HEB.8.1,"Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum : We have such an high priest , who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens ; ",b.HEB.8.1,Akana e bari diela si kadia : si ame ek Baro Rasha kai lashardia o drom le manushenge te zhan ka Del . O Kristo si amaro Rasha kai si ando rhaio ai Wo beshel pe rik e chachi le Devlesko ( o than le luvudimasko ) . 
b.HEB.8.2,"A minister of the sanctuary , and of the true tabernacle , which the Lord pitched , and not man . ",b.HEB.8.2,"Wo si o pasturi ande tamplo ando rhaio . Le manush chi kerde o chacho than ando rhaio le vastensa , numa O Del kerdia o chacho than ando rhaio . "
b.HEB.8.3,For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices : wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer . ,b.HEB.8.3,"Ai swako baro rasha pe phuv kerelas so mangel o zakono , leski buchi sas te mudarel le zhegani ai te del podarki po altari ka Del . Ai vi O Kristo trobul te del ek sakrifis . "
b.HEB.8.4,"For if he were on earth , he should not be a priest , seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law : ",b.HEB.8.4,"O sakrifis kai Wo dia si mai mishto sar le rashai pe phuv dine . Te beshel pe phuv O Kristo , wo nas te avel ek rasha sar lende , ke le rashai pe phuv den podarki sar mangel o Zhidovisko zakono . "
b.HEB.8.5,"Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things , as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle : for , See , saith he , that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount . ",b.HEB.8.5,"Kadia buchi ferdi sikavel ek patreto pa o chacho than ando Rhaio . Kana o Moses kerelas e tsera , O Del phendia leske te kerel e tsera le luvudimaski sar wo sikadia leske po plai Sinai . "
b.HEB.8.6,"But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry , by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant , which was established upon better promises . ",b.HEB.8.6,"Numa e buchi le Kristoski vorta si , ai O Kristo si o ablakato kai zhal mashkaral O Del ai o manush . O rasha pe phuv podail tela o zakono ferdi . O nevo kontrakto kai O kristo dia ame si mai mishto ai pherdo mishtimos . "
b.HEB.8.7,"For if that first covenant had been faultless , then should no place have been sought for the second . ",b.HEB.8.7,"Te sas vorta o kontrakto phuro , chi trobulas te thol les rigate ai del aver . "
b.HEB.8.8,"For finding fault with them , he saith , Behold , the days come , saith the Lord , when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah : ",b.HEB.8.8,"Nas raduilpe O Del le manushensa , sar le manush traiinas ai kerenas , ke kerenas so phendia o zakono o phuro . O Del phendia , "" O dies avela kana kerav o nevo drom le Zhidovongo ai kodola andai vitsa le Judahoski luvudina ma . "
b.HEB.8.9,"Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt ; because they continued not in my covenant , and I regarded them not , saith the Lord . ",b.HEB.8.9,"O nevo kontrakto le luvudimasko chi avela sar o phuro zakono le luvudimasko kai dem lenge dada , kana lem le pala o vas ai ingerdem le avri andai o them o Egypt : Won chi kerde so phendia o zakono , ai trobulsardem te dav aver . "
b.HEB.8.10,"For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days , saith the Lord ; I will put my laws into their mind , and write them in their hearts : and I will be to them a God , and they shall be to me a people : ",b.HEB.8.10,"Numa kadia si o nevo kontrakto kai kerav le Zhidovonsa , kana o dies avela phenel O Del : Me ramov murhe zakonuria pe lenge goji , ai ramov le ande lenge ile . Ai won zhanen so te keren bi te phenav lenge so te keren . Me avava lengo Del , ai won avena murho narodo . "
b.HEB.8.11,"And they shall not teach every man his neighbour , and every man his brother , saying , Know the Lord : for all shall know me , from the least to the greatest . ",b.HEB.8.11,"Khonik chi trobul te sicharel lesko vortako vai lesko phral te zhanel le Devles , ke savorhe anda lende vunzhe zhanen ma , katar le teliardo zhi ka le bariardo . "
b.HEB.8.12,"For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness , and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more . ",b.HEB.8.12,"Ke Me iertiva lenge bezexa , ai chi mai serava lenge bezexa . "" "
b.HEB.8.13,"In that he saith , A new covenant , he hath made the first old . Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away . ",b.HEB.8.13,"Kana O Del dia duma pa o nevo kontrakto , Wo phendia lenge kai o phuro kontrakto gata sas , ai chi mai trobul les ke wo thodia les rigate . "
b.HEB.9.1,"Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service , and a worldly sanctuary . ",b.HEB.9.1,"O pervo kontrakto mashkar O Del ai lesko narodo sas le zakonuria le swuntone buchake , ai sas ek swunto tsera pe phuv . Andre sas dui sobi . "
b.HEB.9.2,"For there was a tabernacle made ; the first , wherein was the candlestick , and the table , and the shewbread ; which is called the sanctuary . ",b.HEB.9.2,"Andre e pervi soba sas o sumnakai kotor kai inkerel e memeli , ai e skafidi kai sas le swuntone manrhe pe late ; e pervi soba busholas ' O Swunto than . ' "
b.HEB.9.3,"And after the second veil , the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all ; ",b.HEB.9.3,Ai palal e duito zanaveski sas ek soba busholas ' O Swunto le Swuntoske . ' 
b.HEB.9.4,"Which had the golden censer , and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold , wherein was the golden pot that had manna , and Aaron ' s rod that budded , and the tables of the covenant ; ",b.HEB.9.4,"Andre sas ek altari kai phabolas e duxi , ai ek baro shkapo kerdia katar o khash kai busholas ' O Ark le kontraktosko ' . Le dui sas wusharde le sumnakasa andre ai avri . Andre o Ark sas le skafidia le baxeske le desh zakonensa ramome pe lende , ai e sumnakai piri le manrhensa andre , ai le Aaronosko rhai kai nachinaisardia te bariol . "
b.HEB.9.5,And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat ; of which we cannot now speak particularly . ,b.HEB.9.5,"Opral o sumnakai shkapo sas le staturia le angelonge kai busholas ' Cherubims ' te len sama le Devlesko luvudimos , lenge phaka gele opre ai opral ai avile andek than mashkaral opral o shkapo le Arkosko , busholas ' E mila skamin ' , opral o shkapo ai tela e vushalin lenge phaka sas o than kai le bezexa sas iertime . Nashti mai phenas pa kadala dieli akana . "
b.HEB.9.6,"Now when these things were thus ordained , the priests went always into the first tabernacle , accomplishing the service of God . ",b.HEB.9.6,"Kana sa gata sas , le rashai avile andre ai ankliste avri andai pervi soba kana mangle . "
b.HEB.9.7,"But into the second went the high priest alone once every year , not without blood , which he offered for himself , and for the errors of the people : ",b.HEB.9.7,"Iek data swako bersh o baro rasha avilo korkorho andre ande duito soba . Wo chi avilo andre bi le ratesa . Wo dia o rat ka Del sar ek podarka pala leske bezexa , ai vi pala sa le bezexa le manushenge . "
b.HEB.9.8,"The Holy Ghost this signifying , that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest , while as the first tabernacle was yet standing : ",b.HEB.9.8,Ai O Swunto Duxo sicharel ame kai o zakono o phuro chi meklia le manush te zhan andre ande ' Swunto le Swuntosko ' sas kotse te keren so manglia o zakono . 
b.HEB.9.9,"Which was a figure for the time then present , in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices , that could not make him that did the service perfect , as pertaining to the conscience ; ",b.HEB.9.9,"Tela o phuro zakono , won dine podarki ai sakrifikaturia , numa chi wusharde le ile le manushenge kai andine le . "
b.HEB.9.10,"Which stood only in meats and drinks , and divers washings , and carnal ordinances , imposed on them until the time of reformation . ",b.HEB.9.10,"O phuro zakono phendia lenge so te xan ai pen , ai sar te xalavenpe , ai sar te keren aver dieli le statosa . Won trobulsarde te keren kadala dieli zhi kai O Kristo avilo le nevo kontraktosa le Devlesko kai si mai mishto . "
b.HEB.9.11,"But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come , by a greater and more perfect tabernacle , not made with hands , that is to say , not of this building ; ",b.HEB.9.11,"Numa O Kristo avilo sar O Baro Rasha pala le lashe dieli kai wo shinadia amenge . Wo lashardia o drom le manushenge te zhan ka Del . Wo gelo andre e mai lashi tsera ando rhaio , nas kerdo le vastensa le manushenge ai nas ek partia kadia lumiaki . "
b.HEB.9.12,"Neither by the blood of goats and calves , but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place , having obtained eternal redemption for us . ",b.HEB.9.12,"O Kristo avilo andre e swunto tsera ande rhaio ferdi iek data sa le manushenge le ratesa ande ' O Swunto le Swuntoske ' , ai thodia o rat po ' E mila skamin ' ; numa nas o rat le buzhneske vai le vetseleske . Nichi , Wo lia pesko rat pesa kana avilo andre , pesko rat skepil ame katar o bezex . "
b.HEB.9.13,"For if the blood of bulls and of goats , and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean , sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh : ",b.HEB.9.13,Tela o phuro zakono o rat ai zhego le zhigenange wusharde le manushen kana kerde bezex . 
b.HEB.9.14,"How much more shall the blood of Christ , who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God , purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God ? ",b.HEB.9.14,"Sode mai but kerel o rat le Kristosko te parhuvel amaro traio ai amare ile . Wo skepil ame katar o nekazo kana zumavas te keras so o phuro zakono phenel , ai Wo mangel ame te podais O Del o zhuvindil . "
b.HEB.9.15,"And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament , that by means of death , for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament , they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance . ",b.HEB.9.15,"O Kristo avilo le nevo kontaktosa , ai le manush sai aven andre te mangen , ai len sa le dieli kai O Del shinadia lenge ai garaven le sa data . Ke O Kristo mulo te skepil len katar e kris le bezexeski kai won kerde kana traiinas tela o phuro zakono . "
b.HEB.9.16,"For where a testament is , there must also of necessity be the death of the testator . ",b.HEB.9.16,"Akana , te merel vari kon ai o manush mekel o ramomos , phenel , kon sai len leski dieli , wo nashti len le dieli zhi kana wo merel . "
b.HEB.9.17,For a testament is of force after men are dead : otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth . ,b.HEB.9.17,"O ramomos nai kanchi zhi kana o manush kai ramosardia o ramomos merel . Kana wo traiil aver manush nashti lel leske dieli kai sas shinadia les , ke wo traiil inker . "
b.HEB.9.18,Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood . ,b.HEB.9.18,"O phuro kontrakto trobulsardia ek martia te kerel o zakono lasho , o rat le zhigenange . "
b.HEB.9.19,"For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law , he took the blood of calves and of goats , with water , and scarlet wool , and hyssop , and sprinkled both the book , and all the people , ",b.HEB.9.19,"Ai kana o Moses dino le manushen o zakono , wo porme lia o rat le zhigenango , le paiesa , lolo poxtan , ai krenga pherdi shut , ai thodia les pe klishka le zakonoski ai pe sa le manushen . "
b.HEB.9.20,"Saying , This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you . ",b.HEB.9.20,"O Moses phendia , "" Kado si o rat le kontraktosko mashkaral tume ai O Del , o kontrakto kai O Del phendia mange te kerav tumensa . "" "
b.HEB.9.21,"Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle , and all the vessels of the ministry . ",b.HEB.9.21,Ai o Moses vi thodia o rat pe swunto tsera ai pe sa le swuntse dieli . 
b.HEB.9.22,And almost all things are by the law purged with blood ; and without shedding of blood is no remission . ,b.HEB.9.22,"O Zhidovisko zakono phenel kai pashte sa le dieli si wusharde kana thodia rat pe lende , ai bi te thol rat pe lende chi avena iertime katar lenge bezexa . "
b.HEB.9.23,It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these ; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these . ,b.HEB.9.23,E swunto tsera ai le swuntse dieli andre si sar le dieli ando rhaio . Won si vuzharde ke thodia o rat pe lende . Numa le dieli ando rhaio sas vuzharde pala e mai lashi podarka . 
b.HEB.9.24,"For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands , which are the figures of the true ; but into heaven itself , now to appear in the presence of God for us : ",b.HEB.9.24,"Ke O Kristo chi avilo ando swunto than ando rhaio pala so kerde le manush , ke kadia sas te sikavel so sas te avel , wo avilo ando rhaio te sikavel pes angla Del sar amaro vortako . "
b.HEB.9.25,"Nor yet that he should offer himself often , as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others ; ",b.HEB.9.25,"O Kristo chi dia pesko traio butivar , mai iek data ai mai iek data , sar o baro rasha pe phuv dia o sakrifis , o rat le zhigenange ando ' O Swunto le swuntoske ' swako bersh . "
b.HEB.9.26,For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world : but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself . ,b.HEB.9.26,"Te kerel kodia , O Kristo trobulsardia te merel po trushul butivar , zhi de anda gor kana e lumia sas kerdi . Nichi ! Wo avilo ferdi iek data ai gata sas o phuro kontrakto , ai Wo dia pesko traio te pharhavel o bezex . "
b.HEB.9.27,"And as it is appointed unto men once to die , but after this the judgment : ",b.HEB.9.27,"Ai sar si phendo kai le manush meren ferdi iek data , ai pala kodia avela e kris . "
b.HEB.9.28,So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many ; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation . ,b.HEB.9.28,"Ai vi O Kristo mulo ferdi iek data sar ek sakrifis le bezexesko sa le manushenge ; ai kana Wo avela palpale e duito data , Wo chi dela pesko traio le bezexesko mai iek data , numa te anel o skepimos kal manush kai azhukeren les . "
b.HEB.10.1,"For the law having a shadow of good things to come , and not the very image of the things , can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect . ",b.HEB.10.1,"O Zhidovisko zakono si sar ek patreto kai sikavel le lashe dieli kai si te aven . Le rasha dine podarki po altari ka Del sa data , bersh pala bersh . Numa le podarki chi kerde le manushen vorta ai chi skepisarde le manushen . "
b.HEB.10.2,For then would they not have ceased to be offered ? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins . ,b.HEB.10.2,"Te kodola podarki dine ka Del dashtisarde te len lendar le bezexa , won chi mai avena doshale le bezexeske , ai won chi mai den podarki . "
b.HEB.10.3,But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year . ,b.HEB.10.3,"Kana won dine le podarki swako bersh , serenaspe kai sas le bezex inker , "
b.HEB.10.4,For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins . ,b.HEB.10.4,ke o rat le zhigenange nashti lel lendar le bezexa . 
b.HEB.10.5,"Wherefore when he cometh into the world , he saith , Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not , but a body hast thou prepared me : ",b.HEB.10.5,"Kana O Kristo avilo ka e lumia , wo phendia : "" O Del , Tu chi manges le zhigeni mudarde vai le podarki dine te luvudin tut . Tu kerdian murho stato ai gata te des sar ek podarka po altari . "
b.HEB.10.6,In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure . ,b.HEB.10.6,Tu chi san plachardo le zhigenensa kai sas mudarde vai phabarde ai dine sar podarki po altari te len lendar le bezexa . 
b.HEB.10.7,"Then said I , Lo , I come ( in the volume of the book it is written of me , ) to do thy will , O God . ",b.HEB.10.7,"Porme phendem , ' Me avilem te kerav so tu manges , O Del . Si ramome ando Zhidovisko zakono kai kerava so manges . ' "" "
b.HEB.10.8,"Above when he said , Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not , neither hadst pleasure therein ; which are offered by the law ; ",b.HEB.10.8,"Porme O Kristo phendia , "" Tu chi manges le zhigeni mudarde vai le podarki dine te luvudin tut pala o bezex . Tu chi san plachardo lensa . "" Kadala dieli kerdion ke o zakono phenel te keren kadia . "
b.HEB.10.9,"Then said he , Lo , I come to do thy will , O God . He taketh away the first , that he may establish the second . ",b.HEB.10.9,"Porme wo phendia , "" Me avilem te kerav so tu manges ma te kerav . "" Wo pharhadia o pervo kontrakto ai dia ek nevo kontrakto . "
b.HEB.10.10,By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all . ,b.HEB.10.10,Amare bezexa si vuzharde ai ame sam vuzhe ke O Kristo dia pesko stato sar ek podarka ka Del . Wo kerdia les ferdi iek data . 
b.HEB.10.11,"And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices , which can never take away sins : ",b.HEB.10.11,"Sa le rashai beshen anda punrhende swako dies , mudaren le zhigeni ai den podarki po altari . Won den le saikfielo podarki sa data . Kadala podarki nashti len lendar lenge bezexa . "
b.HEB.10.12,"But this man , after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever , sat down on the right hand of God ; ",b.HEB.10.12,"Numa O Kristo dia pesko traio ka Del iek data pala amare bezexa sar ek sakrifis , ai porme beshlo tele kai e rig e chachi le Devlesko , "
b.HEB.10.13,From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool . ,b.HEB.10.13,ai azhukerel leske duzhmanonge te aven thodine tela leske punrhe . 
b.HEB.10.14,For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified . ,b.HEB.10.14,"Ai pala iek sakrifis wo kerdia sa kodolen vorta angla Del sa data , ai won avena kerde swunto . "
b.HEB.10.15,"Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us : for after that he had said before , ",b.HEB.10.15,"O Swunto Duxo phendia amenge kadia , ke wo phenel , "
b.HEB.10.16,"This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days , saith the Lord , I will put my laws into their hearts , and in their minds will I write them ; ",b.HEB.10.16," "" Kadia si o nevo kontrakto kai kerava lensa . Kana kodia dies avela , phenel le Devles , thava murhe zakonuria ande lenge ile , ai ramov le pe lengi goji . "" "
b.HEB.10.17,And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more . ,b.HEB.10.17,"Porme wo phenel , "" Chi serav ma lenge bezexa ai lenge shubimata na mai . "" "
b.HEB.10.18,"Now where remission of these is , there is no more offering for sin . ",b.HEB.10.18,Chi mai trobul le podarki po altari ke amare bezexa si iertimele . 
b.HEB.10.19,"Having therefore , brethren , boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus , ",b.HEB.10.19,"Murhe phral , akana ame zhanas kai zhas andre ando swunto than ke o rat le Jesusosko sas dino . "
b.HEB.10.20,"By a new and living way , which he hath consecrated for us , through the veil , that is to say , his flesh ; ",b.HEB.10.20,"Kadia si o nevo drom kai si freshko ai del traio , ke O Kristo phuterdia e zanavesk kana shindili ande donde de opral zhi tele - lesko stato - te mekel ame te zhas andre ka o swunto than le Devlesko .

b.HEB.10.21,And having an high priest over the house of God ; ,b.HEB.10.21,Si ame ek Baro Rasha kai poronchil po kher le Devlesko . 
b.HEB.10.22,"Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith , having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience , and our bodies washed with pure water . ",b.HEB.10.22,"Aven , zhas andre pasha Del le ilosa o chacho ai pherdo pachamasko . Ke lesko rat vuzhardia ame ai ke amaro stato sas xalado le paiesa o vuzho . "
b.HEB.10.23,Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering ; ( for he is faithful that promised ; ) ,b.HEB.10.23,"Akana ame sai dikhas angle ka o skepimos kai O Del shinadia amenge , inkeras amaro pachamos ai pachas , ai sai phenas le kaver manush kai o skepimos si amaro , ai O Del kerel so Wo phenel .

b.HEB.10.24,And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works : ,b.HEB.10.24,"Pala so wo kerdia amenge , ame trobul te zhutis iek kavreste te sikavas e dragostia ka le kaver manush ai te keras o lashimos . "
b.HEB.10.25,"Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together , as the manner of some is ; but exhorting one another : and so much the more , as ye see the day approaching .

b.HEB.10.26,"For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth , there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins , ",b.HEB.10.26,"Te mai keras o bezex mai iek data ai mai iek data kana premisardiam ai zhangliam o chachimos , nas chi iek podarka te lel amendar le bezexa . "
b.HEB.10.27,"But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation , which shall devour the adversaries .

b.HEB.10.28,He that despised Moses ' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses : ,b.HEB.10.28,"Kana o manush chi kerdia o zakono le Mosesosko , wo sas mudardo bi la milasa pala le vorbi katar dui vai trin marturia . "
b.HEB.10.29,"Of how much sorer punishment , suppose ye , shall he be thought worthy , who hath trodden under foot the Son of God , and hath counted the blood of the covenant , wherewith he was sanctified , an unholy thing , and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace ?

b.HEB.10.31,It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God . ,b.HEB.10.31,Si e darai diela te perel ande le vas le Devlesko o zhuvindil ! 
b.HEB.10.32,"But call to remembrance the former days , in which , after ye were illuminated , ye endured a great fight of afflictions ; ",b.HEB.10.32,Seren tume sar sas ande kodola dies kana ashundian o chachimos . Chinuisardian but .

b.2PE.1.16,"For we have not followed cunningly devised fables , when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ , but were eyewitnesses of his majesty .

b.2PE.3.10,"But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night ; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise , and the elements shall melt with fervent heat , the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up .
